137272710,1679290,"I need to praise the effort put into the art direction, which is remarkably consistent, and of high quality. The irony in some of the depictions of nations and historical characters sometimes is rather unfunny (to me).

As a war game this is a complete non-event. It is a strategy game with a very well-defined theme and very shallow but finicky battle mechanics. The rules of Kriegspiel are simple, yet deep - and it is a 200 year old game system meant to simulate this very era. Why just don't implement it and put a coat of 21st century snazzy graphics on top of it? There is no tactical nuance: you move to contact, fire, wait for the AI to charge... and that's it. 

The map is crowded with HUGE icons that are supposed to hover over your units. The problem being that those icons sometimes do not register clicks and most of the time are obscuring the battlefield. They convey a lot of information about your units, but do not allow to analyse the terrain. 

""Historical battles"" are essentially MP matches where each player starts in a corner of the map and has to maneuver to contact. The best thing about the historical battles is the opening paragraph giving brief yet well done historical notes to give some context to the player.

A detailed comparison of Fire & Maneuver with games that actually try to simulate (in similar periods) the subject matter is unfair, and an exercise that I leave for the readers of this review. I think too that it may be the gateway for some to get interested into wargaming. The period depicted is super interesting and kinda exotic. It is just too bad for an old grognard like me that since the release of SSI's Age of Rifles (like 30 years ago) there hasn't been a war game published that struck a good balance between historicity and gameplay covering this period. This is not it, but good try.",0

The job of a crime scene cleaner is hard and thankless. For some reason, garbage cans are constantly checked, too scrupulous guards for some reason ask why your companion in a wheelchair looks so sick, the authorities do not give bonuses for harmful work. So it remains only to admire the medals for the perfect cleaning, hanging on the wall in the secret room. The crime scene cleaning puzzle game is back and doing it very well. I can't say that the formula for the success of the first game is somehow radically developing, rather, it exploits the potential that has already been developed to the maximum. We have a large number of new cases here, new funny incidents, confusing situations that baffle you, the black humor of the protagonist. All the cases are very witty and crisp, some of them are rather big in scale, the creators do not put pressure on you, but give you the opportunity to explore colorful locations to your heart's content. The game looks delicious, the recognizable visual style of the creators gives its flavor to what is happening. Minor roughness does not spoil the game, but it is impossible not to notice them. For example, in some places you have too many items in your inventory, and you simply don’t know what to do, and the decision turns out to be not the most logical. This is ESPECIALLY about the use of light sticks, which suddenly enter the action almost on a new game mechanic that did not exist until then, and you keep trying to use them directly in dark tunnels. A purely personal reproach is the location of the hint button next to the inventory and the map, an accidental click on which breaks the achievement. In all other respects, the game is just great; it gives such a good charge of vivacity, delighting with black humor and a strange anti-Bond atmosphere. This is exactly what we were waiting for after the release of the first part; the creators did not spoil their child with something unnecessary, competently using the foundation of the first game. Of course I recommend and look forward to new cleanings!",1

137273689,1860510,"This game is very fun, but it's difficult to say whether it will become abandonware in a year's time. I wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" button. It's currently very fun, and it would be quite suitable in it's present state, but there are a few important but minor changes I feel need to be made as soon as possible before I can recommend it:

1. (Necessary) Ability to set how powerful/aggressive you want rebels to be. Currently they will somehow out-produce real nations, creating many tanks and armored vehicles in the time it takes you to produce a few. They seem to have unlimited manpower, money, and to spawn whatever ammo and weapons they need. They break my immersion so much I'd just turn them off if I could.

2. (Desired) Map needs to be larger and countries should not all be so close to each other in power. Would also be nice if there was usually more of a buildup to war and ways to prevent it, rather than the enemy just walking over your border without warning of any kind. (Though would be cool if that still happened sometimes as a surprise attack)

3. (Necessary) Tanks should be able to fire shell then swap to machinegun while reloading. The reloading time after firing a shell must pass before you can fire the machinegun. Tanks have loaders so the gunner can keep firing a machinegun while it reloads.

4. (Desired) Vehicle MGs need to be more accurate. Right now it feels like a big floppy salmon that just sort of fires bullets in random directions with a vague bias toward where you're aiming.",0
137273626,2181140,"Hope's End is an enjoyable game that's easy to learn, making it accessible to a newcomer like me to the tower defence genre. It has a good balance between challenge and light fun, with well-paced rounds that keep things interesting. The developers are responsive to community feedback with regular game updates. It's a fun and engaging game that is definitely worth trying out.",1
137272328,2181140,"Fun tower defense game, though the initial learning is a bit rough because everything is thrown at you at once, it's ultimately pretty simple. My only complaints are the menu music being at too loud a default volume, and how hard it can be to locate those guys that damage all of your buildings. (I've spent the entire timer looking and still failed to find it, multiple times.)

It could use some real death animations, and more impressive/notable animations in general. As it is, it isn't super impressive, but it is definitely a solid tower defense game and the amount of upgrades and modifiers should keep it interesting in my free time.",1
137274560,1289340,"I'm a bit surprised this game is fully released. To me it still feels very bare.  It's a fun little restaurant game but it gets repetitive really fast. What bugs me most is there's very limited possibilities for decoration and furniture. I feel like this selection could've majorly approved upon.

After a while of playing, things get more demanding and start making less sense. It seems I have to keep adding equipment to my kitchen. 3 dishwashers, 4 dishwashers... Cabinets for tableware, multiple coffeemachines and mixers and everything seems to want more. I would've preferred if it would go a bit slower and more relaxing.

Having said all that, I do like the feel of the game. It's very easy to play, it's intuitive and I will probably come back to play more of it. I'm secretly hoping there might be more decoration and options in the future.",1

137275214,986130,"Having sunk 14 hours into this game in one day, I should probably give my input!

The short version is this. Yes, it is early access. Yes, there are bugs, glitches and I have had to reset a few times, but I have no doubt that this game will be phenomenal once everything has been sorted. If you love immersive sims and the idea of being a detective buy this game. Don't let the early access tag turn you away! So anyway, I'll give an example of a case I had if you are interested and some of my thoughts on the game thus far! 

I have been anticipating this game for a very long time. As a fan of Deus Ex, Dishonored and immersive sims in general, this game was right up my ally! In my current run I decided to run the Dead of Night (the tutorial which I strongly recommend you play), just to get me back into the swing of things after the demo. Completing my first murder case I decided to rest my weary head for a few hours in my new apartment - that is until my scanner went off... Another murder had just taken place a few blocks away.

Arriving at the crime scene and sneaking my way past the enforcer at the door, I was greeted by a truly disturbing sight. A woman looking to be in her early 30s, brown hair and in her pyjamas, slumped against the wall with some kind of ritual circle drawn around her. I proceeded to investigate the scene, looking in the trash, searching the body and establishing a cause of death; a fatal gunshot. I searched her computer and unlocked the safe, no signs of forced entry... It looked like a dead end.

Just as I had given up and was about to move on to another lead, I saw a crumpled piece of paper on the floor. At first I didn't even notice it. Examining it, I was once again floored. The killer had written a message, taunting whoever was trying to solve this crime. The piece of paper stated that the killer wanted to play a game and wanted me to guess their identity by deciphering the jumble of letters in the correct order. Admittedly I spent a few minutes writing down a few names which didn't look right. My wife got it instantly! Using her brilliant deduction, we got a name. Ellis Leroy, or E.Leroy as it was on the scrap of paper. He thought he was being crafty, but he was very wrong.

Finding his address and breaking in, I knocked him unconscious and handcuffed him before he knew what was happening. Not only did I find the murder weapon and other incriminating evidence, I found out his occupation... HE WAS AN ENFORCER! An honest to god enforcer who committed murder! I turned my case in with all the relevant evidence to city hall, it was their problem now. My work was done... Time for another coffee and some fried chicken.

While this case didn't take long to solve, I went through so many loops to find the truth and it felt fantastic. The other murder cases I have completed have also been interesting, but this was my second case and it really stood out to me. If you enjoy sleuthing, being a detective and immersing yourself in a random city with citizens going about their business, then give this game a go. Again, there are problems with the game, but I believe they will be ironed out in good time!

The good:

- The randomly generated worlds look incredible. The art style really does compliment this type of game.
- The murder cases are very interesting! While some cases can be solved quickly, some cases will take longer. Others may not be solved at all, that's just the way it is. Cold cases are a thing in this game too.
- The implants are very cool, very reminiscent of Deus Ex. From being able to carry more items to seeing how much money people earn from their jobs, you can customise your detective however you like!
- It is amazing to see people going about their own lives! The fact that they can be fine one minute, then just break down and commit murder is insane. The citizens are not perfect by any means ( see below for more info).
- THE BULLETIN BOARD! YES! Admittedly I am still working on ways to make sure it does not look like a complete wreck, it is very cool seeing the evidence right there and being able to add your own notes and connections!

The so so:

- Some of the side jobs are a bit hit and miss. I can appreciate that this is very early in the games run time and no doubt that other mission types will possibly be implemented, but there isn't a lot of variety.
- This game does not really hold your hand (unless you do the tutorial). If that is a thing that dissuades you, this may not be the game for you. You can spend an hour or many hours doing a case. That's just the way it is.
- Now I don't want to say that this next point is bad because it isn't, I just thought I should mention it. While the citizens do have their own routines, jobs etc to do, there are issues. Many people just glitch through walls, will randomly leave their apartments as if going to work, only to turn around and head back into their home again. Again, I can appreciate that this is still early days.
- While I did compliment the bulletin board, there are problems. Sometimes things just don't register for whatever reason! AGAIN, sounds like a broken record, early days, early access etc etc.

Are these problems enough to stop me playing? Absolutely not. Should you put off playing because of early access? I would say no, but to each their own I suppose. Shadows of Doubt has so much potential and I cannot wait to see what's in this games future. This could easily be my game of the year! Happy sleuthing detectives! I hope you found this review to be helpful!

137275007,986130,"This is something special. 

Back when I finished Return of the Obra Dinn I was met with a sadness because I could never really play and experience it again. Once you'd solved everything it would be the same on another play through. The mysteries had been revealed, you know what happened and to who. That real sense of solving a case and drawing conclusions yourself was lightning in a bottle. No other mystery games really came close to the sense of freedom Obra Dinn gave you in investigating.

Shadows of Doubt is the game to finally give me that same feeling. It's small open word and procedural environments lend so well to creating fun and engaging bottle mysteries. The case board gives that great sense of freedom in drawing conclusions and piecing things together. It's progression systems feel rewarding, having you start with nothing needing to solve cases to make money to buy gear and even a place to live.

There's early access shakes. Some rough edges need sanding and it could use some more case structures and environments. Judging by the roadmap it looks like a lot of that will be addressed soon enough.

This is already looking like it will be a phenomenal game. It'll either blow up as more content comes and people catch on or it'll be a cult sleeper hit. Get around it.",1
137274471,986130,woooowooooo,1
137274059,986130,"Insanely impressive, especially from a solo dev with a team of contractors. It's a little rough around the edges, with the occasional glitch through a wall or broken dialogue, but overall it's something really well done and unique.

It's immersive as all get out too. The short sting of a Bladerunner-type soundtrack kicking in after you've turned on your lights and looked out the windows into the rainy, foggy, noir cityscape had me invested in record time. I spent about 20-30 minutes just looking around my apartment, checking drawers, opening and closing blinds, listening to the TV. Awesome stuff.

The tutorial holds your hand a very mild amount to get you acclimated to the game and it kicks you off with a very simple case. However, that case can be completed in multiple different ways which makes the tutorial alone almost worth the small 20 dollar price of admission. Once you've wrapped that case up (successfully or not), you get ushered into the sandbox environment with your own apartment and the freedom to make your living the way you see fit.

Aside from the murder cases, there are small side cases such as tracking down and arresting people for the privatized enforcers of the city because it's too beneath them. They know they're guilty, but they just can't be bothered to enact justice so they contract it out to you.

There's a real sense of scale considering you can go into absolutely anywhere in the city and talk to absolutely everyone. You see people going to work, coming home, you can break into their apartments and snoop on their life, whether for a case or not. If you're a private investigator with a more flexible moral compass, you can finance your life via thievery. As long as you have some place to live, food to eat, and delicious Starch Kola to drink, you're succeeding.

The only true negative I'd say is with the combat. It has a very limited punch / counter punch mechanic that somewhat works. You can also equip every day items like knives or hammers to use as melee weapons. If you can find ammunition, you can use guns as well, but I haven't had much luck doing that yet.

Overall, it's an insanely impressive, immersive, and ambitious outing for anyone, let alone a developer this small. At 20 bucks, I absolutely recommend it if you are at all interested in the noir sci-fi setting and games like Deus Ex. An open world, constantly evolving immersive sim is a dream game to me and I can see myself getting dozens of hours out of this even before the rest of the updates.",1

137273293,1185780,i don't no why every one is moaning about i just played the game for 1.9 hours and had no trouble with the game at all. i have seen aaa games in worst state on early release keep up the great work,1
137273226,1432380,"This is a neat indie FPS with a bit of souls-like mechanics i.e. you can dash out of the harms way (no iframes though) and parry and riposte for a satisfying counter attack. Fast paced melee combat is complemented by a few spells which have weak and strong variant and they can be quite OP if used tactically. 
Dying means getting respawned at the latest checkpoint with full health while the not-already-dead mobs get full health as well and you lose a 1000 score points. This allows for little bit of cheesing, especially first two bosses who don't heal to full HP (my guess is so they are easier to handle early in the game) and I would like to see a bigger penalty for death since currently it removes the stakes unless you constrain yourself of cheesy play. I would also like to see some form of post level screen just to be informed of collected / missed items and enemies.
One big flaw I would like to point out is that there is only one melee weapon at the moment, hope we can get new ones as the game develops further.

Overall it is a fun game for fps / souls fans well worth the price.",1
137275585,909320,It takes a while for the game to get going but once you unlock more powers and figure things out it gets really really fun. There's so many things you can do to mess with the characters. The monsters may sometimes get in the way and abduct or kill your targets so I use my spells on them instead lol.,1
137274708,909320,"The game still feels incomplete to me. There is no satisfying end goal to pursue beyond *Win* and the game is still to easy. Ultimately playing with the difficulty settings might make the game *Longer* but not *harder*, and will just lead to lots of waiting around. There isn't really any rival force to compete with while you take the time to torment the villagers and gain power, or just kill them off without much struggle. 

Additionally you still cant *Summon your Ruinarch* which is something i have been waiting for since very early in the games lifespan, despite it being talked about quite a bit. If we could potentially summon an avatar of our character it would add meaning to all this gathering dark energy to build a portal stuff instead of it just being a bit of a slog. The amount of control you have over your own cultists and demons is also incredibly insignificant and to be perfectly honest, its probably better to not make a cult at all. It would be cool if there was a possesion ability to directly take over a cultist or something at least. Cults tend to lose the ability to progress since they kick out 95% of the village or start from scratch, and after spending tons of effort forming them they will inevitably die off to something silly offscreen. It can be very hard to keep anyone alive in this since all Villagers seem hellbent on killing themselves one way or another. Your better off just manipulating your pet villager from the shadows and not forming a demon cult faction to bring them under, or they will become fairly useless pretty fast.

Anyway as of now the best way for the game to *fight back* is by ether summoning angels/spirits to attack you when you intervene directly to often (But this always backfires and just makes me far more powerful since i can enslave their angels and make an op army of fallen angels, and they give tons of chaotic energy to fuel my powers. Because of this turning the retaliation to max actually makes the game go a lot quicker and more smoothly) or randomly locking away your powers when someone happens to get the trait that allows them to do so, though this is only really an annoyance that you will probably fix pretty fast after turning them into a pile of gore. It would be nice if the Gods worshipped by your enemies could create a champion that is actually a threat to combat you, make them actually un-corruptable and difficult to knock out (not just blessed since you can easily remove that as was shown with excalibur, which btw i havent seen in centuries. They pretty much never get to even try using the holy sword against you. Not that it would help since they are easy to kidnap by knocking them out with a raiding squad)

Anyway as it stands now, it will probably be fun initially while you learn how to play the game, but lose its luster and become dull after you know how it works. In the end i feel like there is not enough meaning to anything we do, and not enough resistance to make waiting for your inevitable victory actually worth it. Just a lot of trying to check the box's of objectives till you get that ""You Win!"" message.",0

137262564,1324130,"The game is good, pretty good in fact but not great. That being said its ""Early Access"" so expectations still exist.
For starters the game is as others are saying, its a Rimworld type functioning game with a different look and feel.

Cons 
It's the look and feel that both brings it up and brings it down. Being more immersed visually creates the feeling to have a mental and emotional need, this doesn't give that (yet). There is no real story or end game goal and by that I mean the experience is at the moment very short lived, what you get 1 hour into it is what you get the rest of the game so far (speaking of the gameplay itself here). That would be the main con in my opinion but again EA so its to be expected at the moment.

Combat is an area the Devs can really put more work in on future updates as it is well to be frank pretty bad. The Draft system as it is ""should"" be a secondary system for the active combat. To make effective use of turrets you pretty much have to create an uncomfortably large power grid that clutters the space making TD the secondary combat system atm. The taming is indeed involved in the combat however its pretty unreliable simply being an accessory to the draft system. 

Resource and space ""balancing"" are also currently more of a chore than a fun part at the moment (specifically when trying to be organized and optimized), this due to terrain constraints such as empty craters from debris sites that remain once the debris is cleared, which some Terra forming functions being implemented would greatly help while staying (realistic).

Pros
The modding support, there is a lot to get comfortable with and can just as easily make the experience better as you can break the experience however, it provides a lot of capabilities. 

Everything that is currently in the game feels and looks unique and drives the exploratory nature as you play.

The variety in resources, and equipment are amazing, in fact having this variety is currently what drives most of the  current replay ability as each map seed creates a different look and feel with scarce open plains to densely resource filled maps. with different resources available on each seed.

The Seasonal effects and time spent within each greatly help the current depth of the game and what it can be.

Conclusion
If you like games like Rimworld, you will like this game and will probably spend countless hours on it even in its current state. Devs are active and consistently working on the game so there is more to look forward to with an already good game. Just understand the game is EA its lacking in areas but excelling in others.",1

137774101,1294810,"So this was a tough pill to swallow.  On one hand I look at the game and see good fundamentals that COULD become fun.  The way it stands right now, it is very buggy, ai is extremely sub par and the game is very poorly optimized, as I'm sure any console gamer will especially tell you on release as they only get 30fps max.  

This is actually the first game Ive ever refunded in my 18 years on the platform.  I am finally at the point where if I cant enjoy the game on release, I don't want to encourage laziness from the developer, and if they need more time to make the game, an actually finished product, then they need to do that instead of rushing their half baked product out the door.  I enjoyed the first couple hours but I could already see the glaring issues at play and Id rather wait and just get the game 6 months down the line when it gets some updates and people actually want to play it",0

137772703,1155330,A good little gem of a game. If you like turned based combat similar to xcom or any other top down turned based game you will like this game. The customization is not as deep as other games similar to this but the characters and battles make up for it. For the price they are asking it is very good.,1
137772345,1155330,"PROS: The tactical shooter part of the game is really enjoyable. Robust, interesting, and satisfying. The announcer can get a bit tiresome, but it's easily turned off.

CONS: Everything else. You are forced to play a 3rd person hide and seek for all these microscopic traps between battles. And the developers seemed to have just searched their assets for ""particle effects"" ""fire"" ""blood"" and ""flashing"" and plopped down stuff as much as possible. It's like the worst kind of easter egg hunt, and makes probably half the time you have the controller in your hand, un-fun.

Same with the intermission hub. Maybe there's a good reason to have it in third person and it just hasn't made itself obvious, but coming from XCOM2, you get all the same functionality (rooms, POI's, etc) but since you have to walk from room to room it takes you 4 or 5 times as long to do anything. 

I'm going to keep playing, but every time i finish a battle now, I feel like I want to stop playing because I have to spend a chunk of time playing a dumb hide and seek game with the developers.

Oh, and if you are playing Ironman, you can't save in the Hub. It autosaves when you enter, and when you leave. So if you quit the game before you activate the next mission, you have to do the entire hub sequence again. 

TLDR: Great Tactical Shooter stuffed in between so many poor design decisions.",0

If you enjoy either of those games I think you will really love this one. The core gameplay is super solid and everything feels quite polished. The only complaint I would have is that it is hard to have an identity in this game. Most games have really unique races that scream for a playthrough with each, but AoW4 gives you so much customization that it is up to you to attribute the identity to your heroes and factions. I'm not entirely sure this is a complaint however because the customization is so amazing and makes the game infinitely replayable. Lastly, I LOVE the pantheon system. Basically it's a rogue-like system where every playthrough gives you experience to unlock different rewards. I love this because at times 4x games can feel unrewarding to finish.

The downsides so far are the little movement heroes have compared to previous entries and that the KI likes to stack a ton of troops which requires the player to do the same which is just annoying micromanagement.

Haven't played much RTS since Red Alert, so this got me hooked by its versatility.

It needs alot of improvement in some areas, others are top quality. 
- It's a slow, running simulator in its current state.
- it lacks customization, in regards to i.e. controls there is no way for you to rebind keys etc.
- It needs more content in general (I know its EA) - but that will hopefully come with time.

The good parts
- The sound design is spot on perfect
- Constructing buildings is very well made, looks great during contruction in FPS, seamlessly going from nothing to something.
- Gunplay feels good, I enjoyed it.
- Graphics, atmosphere and vibe are in general really well made.

But it's current state is still a bit lacking. I would recommend it if you like the idea of RTS & FPS, want to support that concept and can see the potential of this. I'm staying hopeful and are looking forward to its progress.",1

137773541,1494420,"Silica Early access first impression:

After streaming the game for a little bit ive got a good 4+ hours and have tried the 3 on release game modes of Arena, Prospectors and Strategy.

Arena - Its a basic first person area free for all, there isn't a whole lot to talk about here as its just spawn in with one of the few guns available and try to kill people or AI. The map isn't insanely interesting and it doesn't have kits like other FPS guns of primary secondary and grenades but for a quick jump in and kill people it does the job.

Prospectors - You spawn in and must cross part of the desert to hold down an area. I was actually looking forwards to this however its very short and aside from one area of wave clearing its mostly just walking in a fairly basic desert and can be kinda dull, you could skip this and not really be missing out on anything.

Strategy - Probably the main reason you got the game, a RTS with people going round as FPS. Over half my stream was spent on this game mode which was surprisingly fun, as FPS its chaotic with shots firing everywhere and i love it, almost exactly what I was looking for, from an RTS view you have command and everything makes so much more sense, The game gives me the same kinda feel as Starcraft 2 with only one large glaring issue, The AI. the amount of times your harvester will just climb onto a rock and beach itself or have 2 of them just crashing into each other is insane and slows down the match into fix the broken ai which will do it again as soon as you look away. Some of the maps are also to bright or way to dark where being zoomed in is pointless. 

All these negative points aside the game is early access and i think there is alot that can be done here and my main complaints will all be fixed with time.

the biggest thing I would like from these devs is to make this a licensed ""DUNE"" game so use Silica as a test bed and then develop the engine for DUNE. This entire concept feels like it would be the perfect spiritual predecessor to the old DUNE RTS games, so devs please get your daddy Bohemia to go out and get the licence for DUNE... it’s what we all deserve.

This review is based on single player alone and with around 8 hours of play only. 

PRESENTATION: 

Game looks fantastic! It’s colorful and dark at the same time. Love the mix of incredible illustrative animated art cutscenes when you select a new main mission and the stunning small town neighborhoods with the mysterious setting of floating static water and blood pools. The 3D characters look great. The illustrative animation intro to the game is stunning.   

Story is interesting enough at this point, with cultists following a “Hollow Man” and helping the vampires out for some reason. There is a mystery of how the vampires were created and as you move around the map, you get proximity dialogue from the vampires and cultists, which is interesting and scary at the same time. Along with occasional announcements you can hear from the Hollow Man, with a beastly voice that helps set the scary mood. Artifacts, notes and journals you find throughout the open world and doing side and main quests, moves the narrative forward. The character you choose also from time to time will spit out some dialogue, contributing to knowing them and personalizing the story. Killing vampire animations are brilliant. Sounds are everywhere and contribute to the deathly environment you are in. Day/Night and weather cycles are executed well and the game greatly increases its frightening mode when it’s dark. Overall, developers have created a very beautiful, spooky, immersive environment.    

GAMEPLAY:

I like how you can only have one main mission selected at once to focus on, giving you some choice in the branching main quest. Mission menus are done well and you can clearly see main quests from side and safe house quests. Weapons are fun to use and varied and upgrades to them work well. I like how easy it is to compare different weapons. Fast travel is possible on the smallish map and movement and fighting is very much like Aracane’s previous title Dishonoured. Though the jumping doesn’t feel as well executed in Redfall. I’ve only done a few special power upgrades at this point from the skill tree, but seems to be executed well and gives a greater sense of progress. Though this is where some issues with the game can be highlighted. 

I haven’t really felt the need to use my character’s special powers because of how bad the AI is in this game. I’m currently playing on the highest difficulty you can start with, which is Midnight. Can be challenging when you get attacked by multiple vampires at once. But the cultists are way too easy and seem clueless, doing things like running right past you instead of shooting. I’ve also come across a few vampires that are just floating in the sky and you can come right up to them and get the first shot right in their face. Are they sleeping …? I have died a couple times so, on this difficulty at least, you will still get some challenges. Still needs to be seen how the difficulty scales. Would have been nice to have the highest difficulty unlocked right from the beginning for more of a challenge for those who like that, which seems to be the locked “Eclipse” mode. Also to mention, there are many things to pick up throughout the game to get some XP, ammo, health etc. Too much of it and most seem a bit pointless collecting, or at least not exciting to pick up. Especially when you are so easily killing everything and just don’t need that much health and ammo around to pick up. It’s almost like there was supposed to be more challenges and things to kill but the game is missing them. Certain objects are also highlighted that you can shoot and they would explode to help you take out a group of villains but the game is not challenging enough to need to use them.  

PERFORMANCE:

I’m on an RTX 4090 and i9 13900k. At 4K and with DLSS on and set to quality mode of DLAA, I’m getting an average fps of 160. Every few minutes I get a very brief stuttering happening in game play. I’ve had the game freeze on me once and certain things like I can’t search bags that are meant to be searched, vampires frozen, and when the game restarts, my main gun has changed to some other gun. Other than that, the game has run well. 


VERDICT:

The presentation in this game is fantastic and overall the level design is executed well. There are some serious issues with the AI and the difficulty level is too easy and these need to be fixed. These, along with the high price for the game, are the biggest areas that are bringing the points down. Still, an enjoyable experience, at least in single player mode.

137828213,1669000,Age of Wonders 4 is simply the best fantasy sandbox game on the market.,1
137828136,1669000,"I came into the AOW series with 3 loving role playing Dreadnought Humans crusading across the map and showing the world magic is redundant when you have faith, steel and crucially, gunpowder. 

AOW4 is an amazing game and one of the few I felt no issues getting the season pass for. Its strength is its variance and replayability, which I think other 4x titles really struggle with.

As mentioned about my AOW3 game time I loved the game but rarely did I ever finish one. I often got bored after snowballing too easily across the map as the tech tree often fizzled out and build queues in cities were resorted to just pumping out units like a 3D printer.

What AOW4 does differently, is it incentivises me to complete it via the cosmetic and power changes to your faction, it evolves in so many ways I can tell that was a core focus of this game. The unit roster is smaller but the possibilities are far more. By far my favourite system is a persistent pantheon, like you are assembling your own dysfunctional Greek house on Olympus. All faction leaders you win with get to ascend and return in future games. Cosmetic gear gets unlocked and new realm choices appear, it has amazed me no other game has come up with this concept before (that I have come across at any rate). 

To finalise, the combat is a lessor focus but still enjoyable. I find it unfortunately limiting only 6 units per army but like you can stack many together to make huge battles occur. It has a learning curve and is deceptively deep with unit abilities and synergies but is something that without the strategic map would be very hollow. 

If I had any criticism is that the cultures seem too bare minimum. Where is my gunpowder units Triumph!? But honestly 6 seems a little low as they do determine the units and at least initial asthetic of your factions. AOW3 did only have 7 and one was dlc so I am hopefuly more will be added in the coming months.

Over the years, Wales Interactive has developed a good Interface and Settings that respect your time. This interface should be standard for all interactive movie experiences.

[*]Noa Bleeker as ""Mia"" (The titular character)[/list]

[b][u]Camerawork:[/u][/b]
The camerawork here is exceptional with a slight bobbing technique that gives a good conversational feel to the entire film. The almost constant camera movement / bobbing helps cover up how many close-in angles and shots are being used which in turn lets them get much more mileage out of smaller set sizes. They did a [u]seriously impressive[/u] job on this. My only gripe is that some of the heavier action sequences have too much camera movement (i.e. think of your average Michael Bay film).",1

The reason I'm giving it a thumbs up it's because this is an indie game, other than that, this has got to be one of the most boring game that I've ever played and that is mainly because the character walks slower than a zombie. It took me 10 minutes to go down 6 floors and get back up. I see that there are a lot of people in the 'Special Thanks' tab and it's unbelievable how none of them told the dev that this game is boring as hell and extra dark that you can't even see anything and you have to look for some super small light switches.

Pros:

Love the action platforming gameplay, which I think is especially important since it's the bread and butter.
Visuals and audio really sell the aesthetic, love the more tonal aspects of the sound design w harpsichord, xylophone, etc.
I love the skeleton companions and I will protect them at all costs.
Love how the different sheep compliment each other in the late-game.
Ungodly amount of content for a game made by students in less than a year

Critique/areas for improvement:
I found it disorienting when enemies would pop in with no vfx nor animation to accompany it
I think the firepit sound design could use a little more ""body"" (could barely hear the fire when I moved the character next to it)
Same goes for the sound when a sheep hits a target, when an enemy hits the player character, I think it could use less ""click"" and more ""oomph""/""smack"".
Sound when the player character decapitates a large enemy sounds more like a bone crunch/apple bite, could use more slicing/gory/juicy sound
When the house uprooted, was expecting to hear more rocks/dirt gravel but the sound I heard seemed more like a reverb-y ""balloon pop"". Same goes for the destructible walls. Obviously, the balloon pop worked for those balloon-lizard enemies.
The upgrade menu sounds seemed to be doing a weird reverse panning effect which I found to be distracting (I'd hover on the left-side icons and hear sounds in my right ear)
Small QoL thing: Would love to be able to back out of the pause menu with the ""B"" button on controller.
I found myself accidentally killing my sheep a lot by spamming RB, not sure why that is a feature. Would have preferred that they stay alive and/or replenish to ten when I do that instead of killing them all off and respawning all 10.
I found myself switching to kb+m due to the complexity and verticality later in the game. UI switching for controller/kbm should happen based on input used, not when my controller turns off. I also found the binding of the special attack to the ""1"" key to be a strange choice (""F"" could be a good replacement?)
Corners of the skybox took me out of the experience.
Serious difficulty spike in the late game. Combat encounters are really long and Baba Yaga's House has an insane, destiny-raid-boss amount of health. Didn't see any health pickups in this boss fight.
Health pickups felt under-powered and while not a high priority, could use audio feedback when picked up

137831921,1294810,"In it's current state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. While many negative reviews are just jumping on the outrage train and are without substance, game really is that bad. It's unbelievable that we are served this. I usually don't buy AAA games on launch, but Arkane always delivered good games so I decided to trust them this time. 

While it was obvious that this game will be different than other Arkane titles and would not follow the immersive sim design philosophy so that we would not get another Prey or Dishonored, it still seemed that this game had good and innovative concept behind it and it would have a quality of its own. I mean, Arkane making a game in a small abandoned town full of vampires? Sign me in! It was literally the opportunity for Arkane to realize their take on Ravenholm level from HL2 into a full blown game. So I was ready to consider this game without comparing it to previous Arkane titles. But this game breaks on practically every front. 

Optimization is the least of its problems. Yes, it is terrible, but you can play it on a reasonable computer on  40-60 fps. Enemy AI is very basic, and that problem is more obvious when you are in open areas. Gameplay mechanics are also very bland and underutilized. There's very little reason to use any abilities in combat when just shooting enemies in the head will do a better job 99% of the time. Also, your ability to use the environment to your advantage in combat, is very limited, almost non-existent.

Enemy placement is also very bizarre and is probably my biggest gripe with the game. To illustrate. I would stroll an empty street during the sunny day and just find a vampire levitating in a park near the road. Just standing there until I get close enough. Why? Game often feels like some fanmade map or a mod for some other game with random placement of enemies. Vampires are such a cool idea, and the opening scene where they hide from the sunlight is so cool. But then you realize that sunlight plays no role. Apparently there is an eclipse, but that is a BS excuse. The best encounters with vampires are in closed areas and dark corners, and that is where this game shines. I expected there would be some system where vampires would only walk freely during the night, and during the day they would hide. Also, its very easy to kill those vampires, so they are not so scary and just become tedious to deal with.

Despite all of this, I can see that there was a great game in here somewhere. In the closed areas where the game is more focused there is that sweet Arkane environmental storytelling. Case in point: the opening level in the boat. You navigate through tight corridors, find a note about a hidden pistol in the car, look for medical supplies find shortcuts to utilize that sweet looping level design.

But then the game decides to throw all of that away for the most part. There are some segments here and there where the good game/level design resurfaces, but they are very rare. Also, the town of Redfall is actually very well made, and there's a lot of ways you can navigate around and explore. The problem is, you barely have any reason to do so. Once again, this looks like some (very well made) map for Garry's Mod.

My biggest regret is that I gave this game a chance for longer than 2 hours, so my refund request will probably be rejected. Maybe after months and months of patching this might start to resemble a decent game, but I wouldn't hold my breath.",0

137833471,1669000,"From the perspective of a life long Master Of Magic fan, I have to say this game is doing a lot of things right. I will first go over the bad stuff, since there is not very much of it. And then go over some general positives.

THE BAD

I am playing this game solely on my GPD Win Max 2. And the performance at 15W is a little sluggish, even with everything at low or turned off. The 2D Strategic map runs like butter, but the 3D Strategic map will be generally sluggish. To be fair in a Turn Based Game its very easy to ignore, but if you expect it to run smoothly be warned.

I think the performance is hindered by the graphical options which are a little lackluster for a PC Game. Something as simple as dedicated fullscreen mode, or the ability to set the resolution manually are missing features/options that feel like rather odd design choices. 

The Render Slider IMHO is horrible tradeoff where anything below 100% becomes excessively blurry, with a weird dithering LOD effect. Let me lower the resolution, and have more effective ways to maybe go as far as disabling trees, or 3D features sur a resources replacing them with flat icons.

There could even be some effort put into allowing people to operate their empire while viewing the 2D Strategic view. I find it strange that when I click on a town in the 2D view, I have to zoom in in order to see its city overview screen. Should be able to issue build and move orders from this screen.

If you want your turns to go buy faster on a low end machine, zooming out to 2D view before hitting end turn will help a bit.

THE GOOD

The thing that I loved the most about Master Of Magic was coming up with Custom Wizard Builds, and trying to push for a certain theme or playstyle that I felt like exploring. Sure it could result in some rather OP builds, but I felt it fit with the whole Power Fantasy Wizard feeling I was going for in the first place.

I dont have enough experience with this game yet to see if the same level of OP could be reached. But from the titles of some AO4 videos Ive seen come out. I think there are already some extremely powerful builds that people have found. This is great for people who like to not only finetune their playstyle, but exploring different ones. It gives the game a lot of replayability which is very important for these types of games.

The way that they broke down races into their appearance, followed by faction, social and other traits makes for an interesting approach to customization that goes a bit deeper than other games in the genre offered before. This is compounded by the rather intricate Tome system with some minor/major changes you can apply to your race/faction. If you take the time to look at the tomes, their spells and unit enchanements. You can surely find a Goldilocks combination that will feel just right for you. It could feel totally overwhelming for some though. Just take your time with it!

The city management and expansion feels refreshing! Great combinations of incity buildings, with improvements you build around your cities. Some of which depend on your tome or racial choices which feeds back into the crazy levels of customization. Definitely a unique take on terrain exploitation when comparing to the older days of MOM.

Another really unique thing is the patheon system. Allowing you to level up your pahteon in its own skill tree. At first I was disapointed as the first skills are related to cosmetics it seems. But afterwards you start unlocking things like unique traits that give you even more customization options to build the craziest fantasy race you could ever dream of! I cant tell for sure. But it feels like this is the first time we are getting some kind of progression that goes beyond just making your wizard stronger while playing a game. You can unlock things to use in future games. I like it!

Overall I am beyond excited to keep digging into this game, as well as see what the upcoming expansions will bring to the table. Not to mention the amazing mods the saints of the internet will create.

No need to rush and buy it. Go look at some YT playthroughs or go read the wiki. If it resonates with you give it a shot! I think this has the potential to become another staple in the Fantasy 4X genre.",1

137832164,1669000,"Mixture between Civ 6 and Total war warhammer, but lacks the progression and strategy of Civ and real time combat of total war. The only selling point this game has over either is that you can customize your nation(even though many customization options are locked behind progression for some reason, you start of with one leader origin and unlock others later which is moronic WHY???), but even that is in the end quite meaningless as all alterations and race modifications you make during a campaign get reset after a match. There is no carry over of traits ( excluding hero progression which is trash cosmetics mostly). 

Just play Civ or if you like the real time combat go play total war. Or better yet play crusader kings...

This is just a mediocre middle ground between the two

Here is a list of complaints after 5.6 hours that I could be bothered to play: 
-The claiming system is annoying, it is a juiced up version of people getting pissed in civ for settling too close. Sucked in civ, sucks here even more

-Trying to click on specific units and moving them around to specific areas on the map is annoying, the world is not hex based like CIV is yet the world has massive differences in terrain. Trying to select an army to move it around is annoying af. You have a flying unit, you cant click on the sprite you have to calculate the terrain below the sprite which is tad harder than it should. Highlight the ground better.

-the combat system tries to one up civilization yet falls straight on its face. Instead of having a mix of melee, ranged and siege units you just fill your armies with the highest tier units possible to get max amount of military power. And then you just simulate the result. Even if the battle is 50/50 at most you will lose one or two units which is pretty much nothing. There are no pyrrhic victories which the system desperately needs to function, bigger stack wins always doesnt matter if it is all supports as long as they are high tier, for 0 cost to you. Not thought through.

-Cities expand in visually incredibly unseemly fashion and it is simply not as fun to manage as it is in CIV 6. Planning things out where to put improvements etc. doesnt exist here. The city management here is quite laughable just spam spam spam all the buildings for points you need doesnt matter what. There is no fixing this. 

-The roleplaying, this games only selling point is completely ruined by the fact that nobody cares who you are or what you are about. The fairy elfs that love nature and kissy face trees and whatever will have no problem with the most evil necromancers as long as the necromancers dont start wars. OR GOD FORBID, take lands the fairy princesses claimed. That is the greatest crime of all unimaginable. But resurrecting babies for your slave armies yeah no biggy. Your race and traits are completely meaningless(and the buffs and nerfs are completely pointless too they affect nothing in any significant way)

-The story is a series of missions that last on average 50 turns. the missions have a plot of ""bad guy is doing bad stuff and it is your duty to stop him!"" But I am 100 evil the most evil crazy lunatic of them all why would you ever ask me to do this??? This is fail RP. There is no evil storyline, you have one story line and you will follow it to the end whether it fits your rulers character or not. FAIL RP. Customizing a character does not equate roleplaying. Wake up.

-The story missions also play out in similar fashion, build up army and conquer cornpops castle. Zerg rushing is completely viable once you realize this. There is no point to starting settlements or anything of the sort. Just build up 4 armies and send them to enemy capital ASAP for free win. And no, you wont miss out on epic gameplay if you do. 

-There is no point focusing on science, culture or war and go for that victory condition because you can just keep spamming buildings as much as you like. But I never even played the sandbox so maybe I am completely mistaken but it sure didnt seem like it from the story missions. They say every playthrough is different but frankly it looks to me that every playthrough will be always equally basic because there really isnt any differences in things you could do. Just build the same buildings every time and annex the mine provinces as soon as you can. Bleh

What I cant wrap my head around is why these 4x devs wont add lineages. I know some total wars have had this, but give the ability to marry allies or nobles to get heirs and as your leader ages those heirs will become rulers. Similar to Crusader kings, but in a 4x setting. But no, instead lets just have this immortal guy in charge that will lead for eternity. 

""Wonder why people think our game is kinda lame"" Because you did nothing new (other than the race customization which again, maybe an hour of content). It just isnt that good.

If you are planning on playing, skip the missions and go straight to a sandbox. Oh yeah the maximum amount of AI is less than 10 hahahahahahhaha
Babys first strategy game over here

This game is Early Access and I already enjoy it so I'm very eager to see how this could get better. As a lifelong fan and USA Hockey official I really enjoyed all the lingo, references, and inside jokes. Great stuff.

If you are having trouble progressing a.k.a. not lighting the lamp enough, I recommend Kelly Jelly as a linemate, her high speed stat allows punishing body checks even at her small size, and of course frequent breakaways. Body check as much as you can, and try not to pinch in any of the three zones- the cpu doesn't seem to know what do when you have a strong backcheck going the entire game.

In a strategy battle, on average 20-30 fps with Ryzen 7 2700X, 32 GB Ram, 3070Ti.
Adding DLSS probably wouldn't be a solution since this game is CPU heavy. In prospector/Arena mode all perfect 120 fps.

Tough to play with vehicles considering you get pretty much no zoom mode or FPS mode, if you're in a big tank and aim at certain angle you won't see anything because of how massive the tank itself is.

137833843,1824960,"Gameplay/Let's Play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzDFQhYIzos

This is a pretty solid VR survival horror experience, reminiscent of the original Resident Evil. 
There's guns and ammo, a flashlight with batteries you need to replace, quest items such as bolt cutters, screwdrivers, keys and keycards, actual puzzles, a healing sprayl, a Resident-Evil type of map and also save points, which in this game are hotel books, instead of typewriters.

The combat can be quite intense, sometimes resulting in an initial jump scare and you trying to center all shots while the zombies stagger left and right, and lunge towards you. Then you have to reload by popping the magazine out of the gun, stuffing a new one in and pulling the top back, all while the zombies charge or attack you. Fortunately you can punch them (with or without gun), so they back off for a second or two. The whole thing takes a bit of practice, but you should be able to reload pretty fast after a while.

While you can open a traditional inventory screen, you also wear a belt with a few bags, where you can pull out healing spray refills, ammo or batteries, depending on what you have in your other hand. A very convenient mechanic, as sometimes you want to refill your health spray/pistol/flashlight REALLY fast.

137984322,2393670,"Magic Toenail deploys a vibrant art style, strategic gameplay, and a charming story to create my pick for GOT '23. The game forces the player to consider their next three moves in advance, as with each press of WASD they will both move one square in a direction and simultaneously shoot one of three magical elements (Whimsy, Goo, and Sparkle Spells) ... ideally towards their foes. Each spell affects the three enemy types (Goo Monsters, Whimsy Fiends, & Sparkle Beasts) differently, meaning each magical ejaculation will either harm or heal the AI's HP. Consequently, the player must carefully use their three moves to ensure they cast the appropriate spell to do damage towards (and not accidentally heal) the corresponding enemy type, while also positioning themselves in a safe spot on the board prior to the opponent's turn. When the player wins a match, they are presented with two clothing items to choose from that they will don going into the next fight. But choose wisely! These stat-changing garments come with major pros and cons that can drastically alter the endgame. Each level is randomized, leading to an enjoyable gameplay loop that rewards mastery over time.

137985111,1669000,"This is the best game I've played all year. It has problems, its far from what I'd call perfect, but I have not been able to stop playing Age of Wonders 4 since it came out. 

Pros:

The game strikes a perfect balance of deep complex systems and accessible easy to understand mechanics. You don't need to understand every individual aspect of the game to succeed and have fun in it, but there is a lot to explore and experiment with when you really want to. I have learned something new with every scenario I play; new spell synergies, new army tactics, new ways to plan my cities, new ways to dominate the enemy. I've played more than 40 hours already and I feel as though I've barely scratched the surface.

The amount of freedom in customisation is immense. The central gimmick of the game is you handcrafting a unique species and evolving them with crazy magical effects to create something that's wholly yours. There are no standard Reclusive Elves vs Bloodthirsty Orcs, Mountain-dwelling Dwarves vs Greedy Goblins. Nothing is set in stone. You can make those archetypal races if you want, but they're just a small handful of the millions of combinations of factions you can create in this game, all before you even get to the magical transformation aspects. It's not a perfect system, and I'll get into some of the drawbacks of it later, but for the creative driven player it is incredibly fun.

Combat is great, way better than previous entries. It's faster, more strategic, far more interactive than its ever been. There are hundreds of units with millions of combinations of traits and enchantments to change how they feel, but it's never overwhelming or confusing. Every unit has a clearly defined role and playstyle that's reflected in their banner icon so, even if you've never encounted say a Demonic Frostling Tyrant Knight before, you always have some idea of how a unit should be utilised and how best to counter it. In older titles, I would tend to just rush to the high-tier units and stomp through armies with sheer numbers because the combat generally came down to whoever had the beefiest melees and the shootiest rangers. Now, I'm actually engaged with every fight. I'm developing unique strategies for each army, experimenting with unit compositions, and continuously utilising low-tier units in my armies for the entire game. It's fantastic.

Cons:

No game is without its flaws, and AoW4 is by no means an exception. Let's start with the big one: the Technical issues. I have encountered a lot of bugs in this game. Models glitching out, UI freezing up and lagging constantly, and no short order of crashes. Thankfully, the devs are working hard to fix everything they can, and there is a ""hotfix"" beta version of the game you can opt into to receive regular small patches as they go. The game didn't launch in a broken unplayable state like we've grown used to these days, and it's improving every single day, but it's still something you should expect to encounter at some point. Here's a few notable ones I'm currently dealing with still a week after launch.

- The Dark culture's archer unit, the Pursuer, has a broken profile picture after receiving transformations. It displays as a giant triangle on a blue sky and just makes me picture Pyramid Head frolicking through the meadows every time I see it.
- When an Iron Golem unit dies in combat, its polygons stretch across the entire screen until it despawns. This one may be fixed already, I don't see Iron Golems in every game, but it was consistent with every unit in the game I saw it in.
- This one really annoys me. When you choose a new research that completes instantly because you have a lot of points banked up, the game freezes for about 10 seconds while it tries to update your choice. It happens every single time you instant finish a research, and that's not a rare occurrence in the endgame. Irritating.
- Ancient Wonders just don't have events attached to them sometimes, just throws you into a fight unceremoniously. I've only encountered this in the Story Realms but it's really jarring when it happens. It might have something to do with AIs interacting with them before you but I'm not sure.

Back on the topic of faction customisation, while there is a ton of freedom for you as the player to create and explore new possibilities for your races, the game frankly does a terrible job of populating the world with interesting and distinct species. Every Free City race you encounter outside of the Story Realms seems to be a randomly generated species with no connection or cohesion to the rest of the game. The game has a bias towards putting a Free City with YOUR race nearby to your starting location, which is great, but it never seems to do that for the AI opponents. I had a game with two Free Cities populated by red mole people. You could not tell them apart, which is a really hard thing to say without sounding racist, and their cities were right next to each other. The two cities were of different cultures, and therefore different species, with no defining traits to differentiate them from each other, and were both separate from the AI ruler who was ALSO playing a race of red mole people. So there's three red mole races on this map and nothing for you to latch onto about any of them. I wish the Free Cities were ruler's race so there would be some cohesion in the world but alas that is not currently the case and it kills a lot of the fun role-playing aspects of the game.

Speaking of the AI rulers, oh my god they suck. The AI in combat is pretty good (though still exploitable) but on the overworld they are absolutely pathetic. All they do is turtle. They build a giant army of 20 stacks of units and just sit in their cities doing nothing. I have never once felt threatened in a war against the AI. They'll sending raiding parties every now and then, burning your provinces and being a minor nuisance, but they refuse to assault you at any point. In 40+ hours of play, I have never EVER experienced a siege on one of my cities. I have done dozens of siege fights and I have never once seen them from the defenders side. The only time an AI has taken one of my cities is because I left it undefended and forgot to build walls. I've only played on Normal difficulty so far so I don't know if the experience if different on the harder modes, but I've read some players' experiences on Brutal being the same. 

The biggest nuisance with that is in the Magic Victory. When you go for a Magic Victory, you cast a world-altering spell that gives you immense power, everyone in the world who isn't already allied with you (assuming allied victory is on) immediately declares war, and you have to defend three points in your cities (or the cities themselves) for 15 turns from waves of spawning marauders and an onslaught of AI armies. Except there is no onslaught of AI armies because THEY NEVER ATTACK YOU! The Magic Victory should be a bloodbath of you defending an endless wave of desperate armies with your incredible power. You gain such a massive advantage from casting the final spell that triggers the victory; every affinity has a unique crazy effect that makes you a powerhouse in combat, on top of halving all of your regular spell costs. But you never get to play with that immense power because no one comes for you. The AI is all too willing to just sit at home and wait for them to lose the game, so all you end up doing for the Magic Victory is pressing end turn 15 times as fast as you can so you can move on to the next game. It's so anticlimactic, they NEED to change this.

Conclusion:

Despite my gripes with the game, both major and minor, I absolutely love Age of Wonders 4 and I want others to love it to. There's a lot more I can write about the game, both positive and negative, but the simple matter is that AoW4 is a truly special game and I believe the developers care enough to make it the best game it can be.",1

The AI is all too willing to just sit at home and wait for them to lose the game, so all you end up doing for the Magic Victory is pressing end turn 15 times as fast as you can so you can move on to the next game. It's so anticlimactic, they NEED to change this.

Conclusion:

Despite my gripes with the game, both major and minor, I absolutely love Age of Wonders 4 and I want others to love it to. There's a lot more I can write about the game, both positive and negative, but the simple matter is that AoW4 is a truly special game and I believe the developers care enough to make it the best game it can be.",1

You start with one house and the only thing you can do is wait on enough money to build a 2nd house. Takes 20 mins or so of just sitting there watching your one house, lol.

I gave it some time and built the 2nd house. Got to sit and watch two houses for 15 mins after that. (got bored and muted/minimized to let it trickle money for the 3rd house.

Built my 3rd house and honestly I'm not going to wait for the next building which is 4 times the cost of a house.

I am IN LOVE with the 2D art. The loading screen, the character talk sprites, the cut scenes, the character designs, all of the 2D art had me at first sight. The soundtrack is also just as wonderful! It was very unique, memorable, and was also one of my favorite parts of the game! To add, I was blown away by how good the voice work for the game was. All the voice actors did a wonderful job for such a small game!
The main piece of criticisms I have are that the functionality of the game play mechanics could use some work, Dark Oden and Weiss could have been more challenging to fight against, wish we got to see more of Oden's pals at the camp, and gahhh I just wish the game could have been longer! 
Overall, I'd give the game a 7/10! While I am taking points off for various bugs and janky moments I encountered, it is very apparent that a lot of passion was put into this and I respect the hell out of that. The story is unique, the characters are charming, and I was interested in the story throughout my entire time of playing. <3",1

137986151,1294810,"First of all: I'm playing on single player and have adjusted the settings to match my setup (low-medium).

I am not experiencing any major glitches or bugs. There are some mild visual bugs like t-posing but (for me) that's it. I've only been playing for a couple of hours but I think I can comment on this aspect at least.
What I've seen so far gameplay wise is fun for me, but nothing extraordinary.

I understand that the multiplayer is heavily glitched right now but for people without friends (like me) the game is alright, I'd give it a 6.5/10.

Definitely not worth 70,- EUR though, more like 40,- EUR so maybe wait for a sale or for the devs to lower the price (should not take long in this case).",1

137986450,1669000,"Overall story driven not as much as AOE 1, 2 and SM.
AOE 3 story bit on the fence if we got to compare, AOE 3 story is nicer in regards of progression feeling, but if I got to think on the custom ruler I do like this a bit more with the pantheon selection and all.
We don't talk of Planetfall (For me that's not an AOE game, it should be consider spin-off I don't like AOE with futuristic theme)

Customisation its got a good amount, I like the minor faction change, and major faction change spells, but what I do feel lacking is the over all species creations.
They made it more cosmetic with AOE 4, so it doesn't feel special in that regards. 
Plus it feel limited to setting your own lore, like there should've been a planes/living environment, it shouldn't just be two selections and then you got to make a choice of either skill type driven or environment.

Overall it's still a good 4x game, but I would say the price of it shouldn't be so high, rather wait for a sale would say at least 20% off.",1
137986024,1669000,"Having played AoW2 very long time ago I found more recent AoW3 not innovative enough to recommend.

This, instead, is proper new entry. I really like the fundamental focus on custom races and campaign generation. The whole set up starts off with exciting you about all the possible campaign and faction set ups. Each map you generate is made up of many different unique mechanics you mix and match at will, and then each faction you can make has to be made up from many different mechanics you mix and match at will as well. It even has long term progression, further outlining how each game you play is a whole new campaign for your wizard, not just yet another bland random map you generate.

And then on top of that the gameplay of each faction is pretty compelling too. The progression through power levels inside the game still have this unique AoW focus of magic being the main measure of your power, you still keep mixing and matching what your race and faction are even as you play and approach end game. The idea of everything from what your culture is to what units you can have being separated into Tomes of magic is appealing to me for some reason. There's nothing in the game that isn't in one of those books, and choosing which books you collect has an almost a gacha satisfaction to it.

Anyway, bought it on a whim just because I'm an AoW fan, but stayed because this is finally a very strong competitor to other TBS empire builders.",1
137985997,1669000,Solid Game and alot of fun.  I've had it crash on me likes 3 times in the last 5 days but with the autosave feature its not too terribly annoying and being it just released Ive gotten used to this.  I expect they'll have it fixed soon though.  game lacks the depth of the civilization series but the combat is way more interesting than civ.  while not badly balanced I do hope we get some adjustments in the future to keep it from being a solved game.  I'm also very much looking forward to DLC and mods hopefully int he near future,1
137987079,1566200,"When I first played this game I agreed with a lot of the points the negative reviews were making. But after the first patch and learning how to play the game, I don't really agree with a lot of the major complaints. The benchwarmers are pretty easy to have good stats on by the second and third area, and your superstars should be able to carry you through the first 3 elites on normal. Even with abysmal speed rolls on all 3, you can still get them to a manageable point. there's items that will give +20 to a respective stat, and training can add up really quick. Some of the teams mechanics seem really cheap at first, but there's usually certain abilities/items that can help a lot against specific teams, so look for combos that are good against teams you struggle with. The randomness to start your run is just part of the game, you might see a lot of the same superstars or abilities show up. It happens, you can't always get the combo you want, experiment and have fun with it. There are still negatives though. Encounters seem really weak right now, they're often time double edged swords. Training for team stats or playing against the spartans for an item usually seems more worth it (The goalie ability encounter seems especially bad on paper but it might be better in action). Defender AI on your team is mind boggling at times, it feels like they just kinda skate wherever they want at times. The opposing teams will have cherry pickers sitting down the ice waiting for a pass, it kinda seems like they combated it so far by just keeping one of your defenders back with them so hopefully its fully fixed soon. The unlock system is slow, with just under 20 hours played. I'm still missing 2 abilities, 4 superstars, and a lot of Shaggy stats. It might be annoying to learn at first if you're having trouble getting out of the first area, but you'll realize how you have to play the game over time. I really enjoyed my time with it so far and look forward to future content and updates.",1

I remember seeing the trailers and some gameplay of this game and thought ""wow, what a neat concept."" However, It just feels so empty, if you are alone that is. I spent all of my gameplay just roaming an empty desert. The game doesn't help you at all at telling you where you need to go. 

I just can't recommend this for the asking price. If you buy this you are just supporting the devs in hopes they make this game what it could be, which is not a bad thing if you believe in their ambition. Until now, it's just an empty barebones concept.",0

137986396,1494420,"I don't recommend buying this game right now, but I do suggest keeping an eye on it and waiting until some patches are made for this to fix some of the major issues in it before you consider buying it. I do like the concept of this game (it's similar to Natural Selection 2 with a player playing as the commander for their team and every us is playing an FPS, but also with AI units as well as the player controlled soldiers/aliens), however the performance is terrible, at least in multiplayer (I generally only get about 10-15 fps in it after each side builds up their bases and troops for a bit and I'm at the recommended specs for this game), being it practically unplayable at times. In single-player, while there are no performance issues, it's pretty bare-bones, being just one mission split into two-parts that can be done in about 15-20 minutes and offline multiplayer, of which there's only 4 maps and two game modes.

While I wish I could recommend this game, especially seeing as I do like the hybrid RTS/FPS genre, I just can't with these issues at this moment. Being a early access title it should get better in the future so I recommend holding off on buying this until some more patches are made to fix the issues this game has.",0

[i]TL;DR If the screenshots/videos look fun, try it. However, it is very buggy, and not balanced.[/i]

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*]Huge attention to detail, many references and voice lines.
[*]Unique cast of characters. No copy pasted characters from other fighters.
[*]Lots of room to explore. New tech and combos are discovered every day.
[*]Good implementation of rollback netcode.
[*]Robust single-player mode (that I have not touched).
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*]Extremely buggy. Bugs include things like post-round damage and button lock-outs.
[*]Extremely unpolished mechanics. The developers do not seem to understand certain fundamental aspects of fighters. The frame data is baffling, throws can only be teched after they connect, and the hitboxes are exceptionally huge. Imagine if Ryu's tatsu covered his whole body and then some.
[/list]

[b]Mixed:[/b]
[list]
[*]Asthetics. This game is very anime, and the fighters are all idols. May not be for everyone.
[*]No ranked mode. Despite having ~6k players on at-the-time, I almost always use the Discord to find my matches, as there is no other way of consistently finding an opponent of comparable skill. The Discord may be found on the Mizuumi wiki for the game.
[/list]

[b]Conclusion[/b]
[i]Idol Showdown[/i] is a very fun game. Casual VTuber fans will find the game's singleplayer content enjoyable, and can have fun mashing online with other newcomers. Veterans will find an uncut gem. There is a lot to like here, and the discovery process can make it feel like you are playing a fighting game from the old-days, where things were broken and gameplay was emergent. However, it can feel like Mugen at times. It's free, and a lot of care was put into the project, so I would recommend giving it a shot.",1

Its a soulless game. The story is unintresting, the world is empty and my god is the AI dumb...

Pro's:
-The looting system isn't half bad.
Thats it really

Cons:
- Very boring and unintresting story.
- The 4 characters you get to play are the woke, overenthousiastic hipster type. The way they behave themselves and talk.... In a vampire apocalypse? In a vampire apocalypse people would be scared shitless.... The people like the playable characters would be among the first to die in an actual apocalypse...
-The quests make no sense. Things like, fix the popcorn machine and put flowers on my brothers grave.... Come on... Its an apocalypse!!! It breaks immersion completely.
- The open world is empty and feels lifeless.
- The gunplay is mediocre at best.
- The AI of the enemies is dumb as hell.
- The game is way too easy and needs alot of balancing. The stake launcher for example is way to OP.
- The game is terribly overpriced. They dare to charge 70€ for for a game thats barely worth 15€...
- Big list of ingame bugs that should be fixed

Conclusion: This game is the perfect example of what is wrong with the gaming industry. Especially when it comes to AAA games. Developers and publishers these days are releasing broken and empty games.... Its completely unacceptable and nothing is being done about it. If a product comes on the market for sale that product should be 100% finnished. Not 70% or in this case 40%.",0
137989271,1669000,"It's an Age of Wonders game.  4X, fantasy setting, lots of places to explore with your heroes and their troops.  You research spells, explore, expand, exploit, exterminate as advertised.

It has some good points, the game is engaging, the auto combat (which I've been using a lot) seems fair, and the world is colourful.  The manual combat is fine, with a tolerably good enemy AI, and lots of options for turning combat to your favour.

It is definitely a 'one more turn' kind of game.

On the other hand, the UX is bad.  The interface is non-intuitive in lots of places:
Your hero can build an outpost to annex a wonder they have cleared, but you can't do it in the province that has the wonder, the outpost button will not show if you try that, you have to build the outpost in an adjacent province, obviously.

Your armies can dig through soft earth underground if you buy the right early-game enhancement, but to do so you need to walk up to the wall, click on the excavate button, and see if the wall is excavatable, you can't actually highlight excavatable areas while being able to move your army.

I've played the game for thirteen hours, according to Steam, and I have yet to work out if it is possible to cycle through your heroes in the hero management screens.  If, say, you have a shiny new object to give your main hero, and want to pass the almost-as-good alternative to another hero, you have to return to the main game screen after giving the shiny to your main before clicking through to the hero management interface to pick the hero to give it to.

I picked up a nifty mythic level unit for one of my armies, but the game started showing up 'resource shortage: souls' at end of turn.  The game has never mentioned souls as a resource until then, has no indicator anywhere that they might be a resource (they're only valid otherwise if you research a particular branch of magic, I think), or hints how to get them, or even if it is possible to do so.  I ended up disbanding the unit, because I had no idea if it would turn on my troops when the turn ended.

Some interface decisions make sense, but overall it feels as though it could have done with a polishing pass.  The tool-tip pop-up information interface is good and works well though.

The game has a big story-driven, multi-stage campaign like-thing going on -- it tries to get you to follow a set of prepared maps, telling a story of dimensional invasion by a bunch of wizards from AoW2 (I think, if I'm reading it right).  I've done the first one, and am not interested in doing any more.  I really don't think that 4X games lend themselves to storytelling or on-rails plots.  The first one felt like a tutorial map, except that the game already has one of those (it was fine).

The story campaign started with a someone trying to be my ally despite severe faction differences, and then they started stealing my territory while telling me how wonderful I am and how I'm doing the right thing to stand up against another bloke who I've barely met and who I'm not even at war with.  It was annoying.  It was also a very small map and the quests given were all very linear drivers towards fighting the other guy.  I feel that 4X games should be more open-world than on-rails.

I think my biggest complaint is the map size.  The maps are tiny, and there doesn't seem to be an option to increase them.  I picked a custom world with four players and the distance between the starting location as 'far'.  I still met the first of the AI opponents before I founded my second city, and the next before I had a third.  If your favourite 'X' is exploration, this is probably not the game for you.",0

138177231,1774580,"This game is just not very good in any regard. First everyone knows how terrible the PC port has been. Even after patches it still has some really poor graphical issues with tearing and artifacting with the occasional framerate problem. But at least it finally goes above console pleb levels of 30 FPS...

But that is just half the problem with this game. This game is half the game that the original was. The story here is terrible as the writers are now forced (no pun intended) to hamfist the terrible High Republic schlock into the story. The Empire plays a very minimal role in the story as they try to jam in more ""LORE"" that doesn't really make any sense with the already established Star Wars canon. The twists and reveals here are so obvious and boring as well. It all just comes off as fan fiction at best.

I wish that was where the faults stop with Jedi Survivor. They aren't. While the gameplay elements that replicate the puzzle solving and collect-a-thon nature of Arkham Asylum still remain, the combat elements that were Souls-like from the original are incredibly poor here. Combat against multiple enemies is a headache as the target lock and then cycling through them only works in small doses. I've often had the target lock just fall off, not work at all, or select enemies I am not even looking at multiple times without any input from myself. Then there is the combat itself where enemies all have some form of unblockable ""red"" attack that your only defense against is to try to dodge. I say try because the dodge button is garbage. It doesn't work half the time and when it does, you will often shuffle your feet and still get hit. This is on top of not being able to animation cancel, so if you are in the middle of a move and they perform one of these attacks, you are screwed. But of course the enemy has no problem cancelling their animations to perform these or their own blocks. I have not been infuriated with a combat system as much as this one in some time. Where the first game took inspiration from Dark Souls to its own unique Star Wars spin, this one bastardizes that gameplay to a very unfun experience.

Hello, I was looking forward to the release of this game.
I played the game right away, so here is my review.
I hope for improvements.

■Good points
・The graphics are appealing to those who like this style (I personally enjoyed them).

To be honest, that's about it!
But for those who are graphics enthusiasts, it's enough to be a sufficient motivation for purchase.

■Who is it recommended for?
・Recommended for those who want a farming game with exploration elements.
Since it is currently in the early stages, there are many areas with locked signs.
(You can at least see what kind of place it is.)
・Localization is limited to English or Polish.

■Areas for improvement
・UI and help are lacking.
The minimap is essential but doesn't exist, so it's easy to get lost even if you set a pin (waypoint).
The help is minimal and once you dismiss it, you can't review it again.
→These are all urgent issues that need to be addressed. It's a matter of life and death for the game.

・Time passes too quickly.
There is a day from 7:00 am to 3:50 am.
（At 4:00 AM, I get sent to the hospital, and I lose a little bit of time the next day.）
It may feel long when written out, but time passes quickly.
The map is large and there is plenty to explore, but in the beginning, there is a quest to just go to a neighboring house, and by the time you arrive, it's already afternoon.
The design revolves around brooms and vehicles.
To clear the bulletin board quests that don't require prior investment, you have to walk around every corner of the map to search for blueprints because it's difficult to obtain them due to the lack of time.
Some people may retire here.
Is there no fast travel in an open world game...?
There is something that looks like a fast travel flag, but it cannot be used at the moment.
If it can be used, the explanation is too lacking.
Anyway, without a minimap, getting lost results in high stress due to time constraints.

・High prices, income does not match.
Half of the sub-quests on the bulletin board in the beginning cannot be cleared without spending all your money to get blueprints.
However, since you need to invest all your money in repairing the ridiculously expensive stalls, you can't buy the equally expensive blueprints.
The price of everything is set too high.
There are hardly any quests to earn money from in the beginning.
Also, there are time limits for both accepting and clearing quests, so you can't just accept them for the time being.
In response to the time passing issue mentioned above, I want to prioritize the broom quests, but they also require a lot of money, so they don't progress.

・Fatal error (from the second day of storm)
From the second day of storm, it began to crash frequently with fatal errors.
Perhaps they only tested the game for one season...
It's all things that make you want to believe that.
The weather has been quite suspicious since the beginning of storm in this game.
It's pitch black at night and you can't see anything, which ruins the game.
I'm just shown a black screen and it's unpleasant.
I can't even see my own garden in the darkness.",0

You expand your trolley slowly into a full on train while traversing the void slowly. Gather resources much the same as in Raft by swimming or grappling them to you. once you have enough start working the tech tree. This tree is relatively linear. each phase contains 3-4 techs to research by dumping parts into them. i've made it to phase 17 and have a two car train at this time. Combat is ok, nothing too fancy. Guns can be modified with drops from enemies and most of the stuff is junk at this point for me. As for the complaints about epic games.

Introducing a visible ""power level"" to players' profiles that is used as some kind of MMR but worse, has made the community extremely toxic. This number is constantly used in arguments and discussion in e-peni* comparisons to invalidate the other user's opinions. Some veterans think they are better players for having a greater number and all their arguments are correct because of it.

While the game is really good, the devs have created a toxic community all by themselves. At this point you should look for another game, or ignore chat / discord / other players completely.

138176592,2349830,"Semi-extensive feedback inbound!
It is quite long, but I hope that the developer will pay attention to it, since I write it out of sheer appreciation and because I see a great potential in Gensokyo Survivors. Also, please note that I'm not asking for ALL of the features to be in the game, but I genuinely think that there's value in making this game better, hence why I am trying my best to write a comprehensible feedback.

Alright, I should preface this with the fact that the game is cheap and probably isn't there to be updated, but is simply there to get money. Thus, the game isn't hard to sell for sure, but at it's current state it is hard to recommend. Still, I had fun, I'll leave my review as the one with ""Recommended"", even though I have plenty of things to say.
On an off-chance that developer(s) will actually listen to a nobody on the internet though, here goes.

While this game is a great concept and a one I longed for since Blooming Chaos was a thing and despite the fact that Endless Dream already exists, I have some feedback to give and possible QoL changes to suggest. 

First of all, I think characters should have a unique trait to their starting weapons instead of them just starting with a different weapon, like say increased damage, reduced cooldown/increased range and/or width for Mini Hakkero (13-15 for having such a long cooldown is ridiculous) for Marisa just because it's Marisa who uses them, but have a normal or even reduced rate of fire with other characters using them if you still want to keep the gameplay challenging differing on a character you pick. Piercing bullets for Reisen's Megaphone Gun, extra projectile(s) for Reimu's amulets etc. Also, please make it so we could choose between vertical/horizontal mode for a starting weapon firing mode. Also, why do characters not have spellcards? I think it would be a good idea to either have a store (I elaborate on that point later) that would let you unlock those, or have a condition like ""kill x amount of enemies/play x amount of games with a character to unlock spellcard"".

Second of all, even locked characters should have a starter weapon indication before you choose to buy them. 1000 gold for a character isn't much of a grind per se, but the only viable starter character is Reimu because cooldown for Marisa's weapon is stupid and doesn't justify picking her first. 

Cooldown brings me to the third point. I think that either a cooldown timer or indicator of whether the weapon is fast or slow should be included in some shape or form. Either when you pick it from the grid or have some sort of compendium for them. 

Fourth point is aforementioned compendium. Please let me read up on what weapons do after I unlock them in the game, if the grid doesn't really indicate much after picking it.

Fifth point is that weapons should have more clarity to their descriptions on what exactly they're doing aside from: Horizontal = hurricane, vertical = rainclouds, at least describe patterns in which they're moving.

Sixth point - cooldown for weapons in general makes no sense, because there should be a clearer indication on what the weapons do exactly. Some weapons that tick for 1-2 damage have same cooldown as weapons that damage for 10-15 hitpoints. Them being multihit doesn't excuse the cooldown since inconsistency still exists. Example being dolls that can just hit an enemy somewhere amidst the crowd. If they kill, it means that there's one enemy down and an EXP lying around which you can't exactly pick up because it's too far. Most of the time it doesn't even really kill anyone because the hitrate is inconsistent. Make fewer dolls but have the strings with their own hitboxes for example. Or just one/two bigger doll(s), also with strings having hitbox, but having a lower hitrate as a trade off for slightly higher damage rate. Makes it more useful in terms of waveclear. Also, back to when I was writing about Reisen having pierce, I think that bullet weapons should all have some sort of pierce rate. If you want to challenge a player, just have said pierce rate vary from item to item.

Seventh point - this game should have an upgrade or fuse option. For example when you get a duplicate you should be able to either level it up by fusing it with an already existing weapon in your grid or make it so that weapons themselves have levels and are upgrading the more you use or the more you kill specifically. And your starting weapon should be upgradeable as well. Also, fusions of weapons after certain level could for example result in a combination weapon, kind of like collabs in HoloCure (if you played, you know, and if you didn't then I suggest you try that game) or evolutions in Vampire Survivors. Tradeoff should be that they take up more grid slots while being more useful. Some kind of enhancement for weapons in general should be a thing, since their base damage will get redundant due to only having flat damage upgrade as the game goes on. For example have it so that some weapons can have an additional chance of being ""enhanced"", like having +percentage to damage or reduced cooldown/increased hitrate. Plus, every game in Survivors type normally has an upgrade menu that ties into every character, increasing pickup range, damage percentage, grid size expansion, maybe put the spellcards as unlockable option there, etc. If you've made a game of said type, then safe to say you've played those. Hence why I think elaborating on the point is not needed. 

Eighth point - mid-battle items. Is there healing in the game? I don't actually know. But there should be a heal drop, an EXP pull in drop, some kind of nuke/time freeze acting like the cross and clock respectively in Vampire Survivors for example too. If the heal is per leveling, then it should be indicated, I think. Would be even cooler if said items would be like a situation spellcards. I think it's within the lore accuracy too. Like a nuke would be Cirno's Ice Sign that freezes enemies, and clock would be Sakuya's Time Sign.

Rest of the feedback I'll chalk up to bullet points, since it would take ages for me to describe and I want this feedback to have more clarity.
- Close gap should have a hotkey to exit it instead of using mouse because then going to D-pad can result in getting damage. Also, please add some kind of knockback upon level up to prevent player from taking undeserved damage the moment you close gap.
- Hitbox circle indicator should be an option, similar to official games.
- Enemies that can fire bullets should be indicated in some form or shape or relegated only to a certain type. Same goes for the projectile size/pattern being less randomized and more relegated to enemy type rather than based on time of the run.
- Better gamepad support, obviously. Tie things to hotkeys instead of your right stick acting as a cursor in this case. Maybe even twin-stick aim/strafe hotkey addition as an option.
- Add a weapon that would act like a pull-in/mini black hole
- Increase blue currency rate or lower threshold for getting a break currency early on with obtain rate going higher the more you level up for the sake of balance, instead of it having a fixed rate, resulting in a very slow and painful start. More weapons shouldn't equate in faster obtain rate necessarily because by the point you reach mid game, you're more likely to have a low HP.
- Make a character disappear after death because otherwise enemies colliding with still existing hitbox creates a very annoying sound.
- Include more OST, please, even if there's only one stage as of right now.

That concludes my feedback. I also allow comments on this thread, so feel free to reach out to me either directly or via this thread if further elaboration is needed. Thank you for making the game first and foremost.",1
138297073,2128270,"It's the character creation from a roguelike dialed up to 10 with short and entertaining attempts. Takes about 10-20 minutes to win/lose and be out there trying another build.

Definitely geared more towards people who like building characters over playing them.  Not enough games cater to the theory crafter, thankfully this one does.",1
138297080,1470390,"According to the achievements, I'm in the top .3% of players, having finished the main campaign loop, and then also finished all 8 challenge modes as well. I'm gonna be honest, to an extent I was spite-playing it towards the end. Some of the challenge runs are really unpleasant (others are challenging in a good way) - the one where shooting enemy shields hurts you is terrible because it breaks the central flow of the game (which is shooting and dodging in time). 

There's a number of things like this in the game where the main idea of the game (the aforementioned shooting/dodging in time with music cues) that make you specifically NOT play in time to the music, which is... really frustrating. Feels like there's got to be a way to introduce challenge without ruining the flow to the music. 

That said, it's definitely not all complaints, obviously, since I played this for like 40 hours in 2 weeks. The music is really solid, and when things are flowing, it feels great - I actually completely tetris effect'd myself with this game, playing enough in a short time that I'm constantly hearing the music (especially the dodge time cues) in my head, lol. 

For $16, the amount of content, provided you like the challenge runs, feels about right. The art style/direction is really solid all the way through, the levels look great, and mostly play great too. Some of the shapes of levels are a LOT harder than others.

To the developer - I don't know if it was just me, but concerning the very 1st challenge run: with the amount of stats you have at that point in the game, and the lack of any purple add-ons, that first challenge is absolutely, disproportionately hard. It took me like 20 runs to clear it, even when I was playing really really well. It felt a little bit too difficult for the first challenge. (After I beat that, I did challenge 2, 3, and 4 in a single attempt, for reference).

Other note - those flower-looking shield enemies that shoot a single high damage laser at you in the 1st act really disrupt the flow of the music & dodging, it just feels really really awkward to dodge those things if you're trying to really groove to the music.

BTW: If you're really, really stuck on a Challenge run, don't sleep on the upgrade that makes enemies expel shield orbs when they get hit by a barrel. Combine that with the ""barrels suck enemies in"" and it makes the final boss a LOT more bearable.",1

138298752,1849360,"Disclaimer, I have been part of the beta test for SGS NATO's Nightmare. So 1) I have received the game for free and 2) I have seen it evolve from early on until now that it is officially published.

NATO's Nightmare was long overdue, an operational level, turn based, turn based computer game of a Cold War gone hot in the mid 1980s.

In this game you control either the Warsaw Pact or NATO's military forces, air, land and naval from Denmark in the North to Austria in the South. That is for the campaign game, there are smaller scenarios and more are to be added where you play only a portion of the map. 

The game has two essentially modes, the basic and advanced.

In the basic game your units are mostly (land and air) divisions, army and corps headquarters, some regrouped support units and small immobile garrison units.

In the advanced game you will have many more small and abstract units under your command. In addition to divisions and headquarters as in the basic game you will also have specialised task forces, advance guards, reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, tactical and anti air missile formations, supply, engineers etc. To play well in this mode you will have to learn the intricacies of combined arms warfare. Just stacking half a dozen divisions together for an attack will most likely lead to heavy casualties and defeat. But if you add specialist units as appropriate for the terrain and units you are about to attack, or defend against, will be key to victory. And of course you should reconnoitre ahead of your forces so you don't get surprised by the enemy the following turn. Playing at this, the advanced, level takes a lot of dedication and unlike you defeat your opponent in a lightning strike also some time. The advanced game is a true monster game and compares favourably with the likes of War in the East or War in the West (WWII by Matrix Games).

While in the basic game you may finish one of the larger scenarios in an evening, the advanced game will probably require upwards of an hour per turn. The first turn in both modes usually takes longest as you regroup your armies to your taste and needs. After that the follow of phases and turns is steady.

I should mention the importance of playing your strategic cards wisely and not squander you victory points on a whim. And never forget that the war can quickly escalate, from the conventional to tactical NBC exchanges and beyond that mutual destruction. Every major action you take can make a difference and no two games will play the same, but it's not an issue of luck, it is skill that will determine the winner, or whether all is lost.

SGS NATO's Nightmare can be played against the ai, hotseat on the same computer or via email. 

If you like this game also take a look at the other SGS series games like Korean War, Afrika Korps, Afrika Korps Tunesia etc. More are to be published including one about the Battle of Stalingrad.",1

138298282,2322660,"Blood Strike review by HyPo Hawking - Review #86
Rating: 5/10
This game is a mess and it needs to be reworked a lot. First i would like to mention this is a Crossfire clone which would not be a bad thing if it was not that buggy and badly done. First of all the UI is really bad.It is hard to navigate and find most things in the menu,whether it be to equip a weapon or open something you received. Second of all multiplayer sucks for this game, tried Classic once and it was bad and just like in Crossfire for me multiplayer was never the highlight, and Adventure seems to be the main mode worth playing. I mean the reason i played Crossfire a lot was Zombie mode and this game has a decent Zombie mode but it is flawed in a way that instead of having one long 20 to 30 minute map session it has smaller 1 to 4 minute smaller maps. Which is not a bad thing sometimes but in this game it is. Also the menu window was really small for some reason and i could not find a way to increase the size of it. Like Crossfire you have two menus. One is for navigating the game and spinning items and the other one is when you click play and it loads the game. Also i have no idea why they download maps separate when they could have just had like on Steam the download full game with all maps and stuff. After 3 hours i decided i played enough. The game is decent but it has a lot of things it needs to rework. I thought winning weapons was neat , instead of Crossfire where i remember i spend 50 to 100 hours grinding for at least one permanent weapon during an entire month and got nothing. And i like that this game has a good drop rate. Okay another flaw i would like to address is there is no European servers and only US servers which i did find a bit odd. So this game is in a sense a decent FPS but i think the Adventure mode that is highlighted in screenshots and cover art needs to be longer and better executed. I did not care for other game modes. It had that one game mode i care about the most. And from my experience the Asian developers make the best Zombie themed games by the looks of things. Adventure mode from what i played around 2 and half hours straight was fun i will give them that but i decided not to waste time on it since i have other games to play and review so i cant afford to waste time on a single game grinding it a lot like i used to, i mean i can but that would mean shrinking the number of reviews i write. Anyways in all fairness a decent game that needs better UI, a separate menu for choosing whether you want to play Multiplayer or Adventure Mode. Longer maps on Adventure mode. It is a flawed game, but the potential is there they just need to slowly go trough and fix everything which i doubt they will. Worth checking for an hour or two to see if it is for you and it is for you calculate do you want to grind Adventure mode or Multiplayer mode for 10 to 50 hours until you reach a point where you are satisfied with the progress you made. I think i wrote decently sized review for this Chinese FPS clone of Crossfire that is decent but needs work to be a playable experience for most people.",0

138299747,1940340,"This game doesn't work as a rouge-like.  In those sorts of games you have a starting point to which you gradually add different options as you progress.  You scrape by until the next upgrade opportunity, and then maybe you get lucky.  Or maybe you get something you've never tried before.  Or maybe you get something that seemed unimpressive before but has some extra synergy with one of your other tools.  

The key is that at the outset, you don't know what you're going to get.  Most runs will end up fairly similar overall, but you never know if the next one might be the time it all comes together.  

Darkest Dungeon II is the opposite of that.  You choose your starting toolbox and that's pretty much all you get.  There will be incremental ups and downs along the way, but you still know pretty much exactly how it's going to play out.  The only difference is seeing how far you get.  Yet unlike the first game, there's no benefit realizing when you're better off cutting your losses.  You just go until everyone dies and start over.  

It's like if Dead Cells or Enter the Gungeon had you pick a couple weapons at the start, and then just gave you little boosts to HP or damage along the way.  Or if in Slay the Spire you never had the opportunity to add new cards to your deck, and instead just got occasional upgrades to your basic attacks and dodges.  Your skill is still tested, but you essentially know from the outset exactly how the run is going to play out.  The only question is whether you'll get enough gas along the way to make it to the finish line.  

I loved Darkest Dungeon I, and I love deck-builders and rouge-likes.  Darkest Dungeon II tries to add those together but just ends up leaving out the best parts of both.",0

138299046,1940340,"Review after beating the final boss.

Pros:
+ Grim, creepy, dark atmosphere.
+ Great music.
+ Your characters are fragile and weak, so adapting to tough situations and eventually overcoming great challenges feels very rewarding (also allowing you to ""keep"" your successful guys).
+ Immersive and inspiring way of storytelling.
+ Fantastic narrator.
+ Tremendous party customization through skill options, hero paths, trinkets etc..
+ Really cool monster design, especially bosses.
+ Combat has been generally speaking significantly improved compared to DD1, thanks to more advanced token mechanics and heavy focus on reactive/adaptive gameplay.
+ Combat consumables are fun to use. Also, spending your hard-earned resources on powerful items on the fly is fun, contrary to hoarding them. (yes, grind for global upgrades exists, but it's not nearly as bad as many people claim)
+ Customizable difficulty levels.

In-between:
+/- The changes to the stress system, and replacing afflictions/virtues with relationships. I'm not sure yet, I guess I have to play more to get a firm opinion on this topic... On the one hand I liked the old system more; managing stress in DD1 was extremely important, and you built attached emotionally to your heroes. Afflictions were such a mixed bag of fun and frustration - but it was such a unique and grotesque mechanic, able to create dramatic and intense experiences for the player. On the other hand however - how the hell would afflictions get implemented to DD2 with its gameplay structure (cart with stuck forward button vs stationary base of operations), without being permanent? So even though I think this system was ""better"" in DD1, I guess it simply wouldn't fit in DD2.

Cons:
- Cart travelling... Slow. Tedious. Repetitive. What annoys me the most is steering it to run over obstacles (which sometimes drop small amount of loot). It doesn't even make sense - like how is anything collected from the ground? And the in-game explanation of: ""don't worry, it won't break, it's made of [i]strong stuff[/i]"" - seriously? Camera movement is sometimes REALLY confusing and irritating, specifically in the sprawl region. Also, it's hard to read hero barks and notice their relationship changes while steering. Unfortunately this is all counter-immersive and I hope that at least the distance between encounters gets reduced.
- Combat tokens are not clearly explained. I understand that orange tokens are supposed to be ""you have to figure it out"", but for many of them you don't even get a minimal hint for what will possibly happen. Same goes for some tokens that have a hidden ""lasts for X turns"" or ""expires after X turns if not triggered"". Like seriously, why is this crucial information not included in the skill description?
- Some skill and trinket descriptions are oversimplified and thus vague.
- Region-specific monster variety is a bit lacking.

TL;DR:
Totally worth recommending if you like difficult rogue-lites.
Yes, it's different than DD1 in many gameplay aspects.
Still a bit rough here and there, but I'm totally going to play it a lot more, because it's very enjoyable and satisfying. Looking forward to future updates/DLCs!

138299034,1940340,"While I still think the Darkest Dungeon (Original) is a far better game, I am enjoying this game as well.  What would be the greatest things would be for them to recreate the original Darkest Dungeon with the newer animations and graphics - keep the game the exact same - just modernize the appearance.",1
138300137,1547670,"The game is still filled out with bugs and there are several improvements that I feel are required for this type of game.

1. The Weapons wheel is clunky and slow. You press F to open the wheel, but selecting the weapon does not close it.
2. Some weapons didn't fire even when fully loaded.
3. Encumbrance is a pain, there's no clear indication for the threshold. It seems to be based on unique items or grouped items but you can only be sure by opening the menu located at the Tablet and looking at the Inventory. You should have an indication for encumbrance in the HUD or at least a clear definition of what counts towards it.
4. The Quadricycle is simple awful to drive. The angle of turn is minimum and it takes ages to respond. You can clearly see they've implemented that slippy physics to it. You stop pressing forward, and it keeps going forward decelerating - which is fine - but during this time, if you press the wheels to turn, it will ignore the command and keep going forward.

The game has a lot of potential but I would expect a playable beta and this is not it.",0
138298940,1547670,"Nearly pissed myself in the tutorial due to the triggering of the monster spawn, was in the middle of reading and screamed so loud I think my friend went partially deaf.

Pros: 
- Overall a good time with friends
- Shooting feels accurate
- Running a long distance doesn't feel entirely like a walking simulator unlike most games
- You actually get to capture the monsters and store them at your base (Bigfoot never made sense to me because you kill it and take a bunch of photos and things for evidence but it never has that ""wow"" I did it factor. I was insulting my first cryptid behind the glass wall saying ""backhand me now *****"")
- Plenty of clothing options for females
- Female physics
- Makes you actually read and find items for good loot locations
- Storyline progression - by this I mean there is a story you have to follow in the hunt, it is not completely random
- If you fall through the world, it will replace you on solid ground

Cons:
- Carry weight has no explanation, a dvd somehow weighs a ton????
- You can have over 10 items in your inventory, but you can not see anything past the ten items unless you drop something 
- Favorites menu is weirdly laggy, sometimes will not pull proper item for weapons
- Bear traps need a tutorial because as of the moment it just drops it on the ground 
- A lot of bugs (Early access, this is suppose to happen)
- Vehicles especially, on the first case in the game, using the atv after the wooden bridge caused it to nose dive into the ground and shoot me at the speed of light underneath the map before placing me back on ground with the atv doing flips in the ground a few feet away
- The turn radius for vehicles only exist when you are going 1mph, any speed at all above that, turning does not exist 
- Flashlight is also non-existent, you cannot see ANYTHING at night pretty much unless you are inside a small structure
- Keys and bolt cutters only work for the person who picked them up, not everyone in the game
- Ammo feels scarce unless you specifically read clues to find the ""secret"" areas with them
- Cryptid health is storyline locked. Meaning you can waste a lot of ammo defending yourself from the attacks and can no longer damage the cryptid until finding specific locations/items
- Cryptid also has insane attack ranges, and when it does hit you, you ragdoll sometimes an insane amount
- Cryptid can sometimes get stuck, and even while stuck if you pass anywhere near it can smack you quickly in progression to instant death 
- Special guns are different variants of main guns
- Not a lot of customization for guys
- Helicopter on the roof will explode your eardrums when you interact with it
- Special ammo is named the exact same as regular ammo
- Story is you are what looks like a teenager whose friends die and you suddenly have a huge million dollar like base and hunt cryptids? 
- Tutorial makes you go through every single keybind in the entire game 

I think it has so much potential! I am really excited to see where the devs take this game, it feels co-op focused! Overall even with the bugs it felt quite challenging to kill the cryptid. In Bigfoot for example it feels like an insane struggle at the start and a piece of cake at the end, A Day Out felt like a balanced fight overall that we had to work for. This is a game I will absolutely keep up with, I really hope other people can see the value of what this game has the possibility of becoming.",1
138300451,1159690,"Probably my first review I've ever written so here goes nothing:

You should NOT EVER play this alone, gathering materials even when playing co-op is VERY grindy and will become old really quick. The basic idea of the game is amazing but the implementation is frustrating, confusing and especially time consuming. I've only played this as a 2 player co-op and gathering the materials for some simple research can take around 15 minutes even when both of us are gathering the material.

The flow of crafting things goes like this when crafting item X:
- Craft 2x of item 1
- Craft 2x item 2, which requires 3x of item 1 each + then some 
- Craft item 3 which requires you to smelt ore, which requires tier 1 wood, smelt those ingots to create tier 2 ingots. But wait, the tier 2 ingots require tier 2 wood. Which is crafted by smelting tier 1 wood.

And all of this is created through 5 separate crafting tables with overly developed UI, going through 7 different option screen just to craft certain items when ALL of the options could be visible in a singular menu instead.

When upgrading crafting table tiers, the old table doesn't upgrade to that tier but you have to craft a separate table, where you CAN NOT craft the tier 1 materials which already is stupid. Wasting space and materials as a whole which are already pain to gather. 

The item stack sizes are really small (10) given how much you have to use the raw materials to craft certain things you will be running out of storage fast.

Some improvement ideas:
- Simplify the UI and get rid of the current wheel selection step by step UI and add quick add feature for something like wood to a furnace.
- Add new researched materials such as the T2 wire and screws to the enemy/container loot table or even the special chest loot table
- Everything gives the T1 material which again has to be processed and further annoyingly crafted through 7 different crafting tables, combine these newly researched upgraded tables to one.
- Add indicator that demolished modules on the train will transfer some of the materials to the nearby storage next to the computer, figured that one by accident - not intuitive at all.
- Make researching cheaper, it's very inconvenient with the current crafting system.
- There is never enough wood for crafting, smelting, fueling crafting table (yes some have to be powered separately) and the train should be running with coal (T2 fuel for furnaces etc) which is either found in small quantities or crafted through T1 furnace. You simply can not upkeep everything at once.
- Stack size increase
- A lot more which I can not remember right now.",0
138299953,1159690,"This game is good, however I suspect it won't be to everyone's liking. If you like to take your time, build up your resources, build out your base and explore all you can, then this game might be for you. If you like to rush through your games or get bored of monotony rather easily, then I'd stay away from this game for the time being.
The concept is amazing, trains in space basically. The execution is slightly underbaked for the time being however. The research station is very restricting, forcing you to research select recipes and upgrades first, and it does take quite a while to get anything done. Some of the mid game crafting recipes do take a while to get through, using multiple crafting stations to build. Metal is a big thing, you will need a lot. I would say that is one of the things that is a little frustrating about this game. It takes so much metal all the time. Space quickly becomes an issue. If you don't speed through the researching, you will run out of train space and not be able to get more until you start unlocking future blueprints. Inventory space and storage space is also a little restricting. Max stack size of ten, and only 4 slots in the basic storage chests, things get full quick.
There are some things that need changing and balancing. The early game is slow, and I found myself solely collecting resources while inbetween gates and then doing all my upgrading, researching and crafting while on the depots at the end of a section becuase it takes so many resources to do anything and I don't want to miss out on stuff I need.
Other than these issues, this is a really good game. Take the other reviews with a pinch of salt. The early game is slow, but with the upgrades you get along the way, it does get easier over time.",1

This game is amazing.

The writing is strong, the characters are all wonderful; and designed and written in a realistic way. 

The story comes together to tell the tale of a relatively broke marching band trying to learn The Planets by Holst for a competition, and you play as the drum major; student conductor. 

The player character is funny, she's connected to all the other characters in a way that feels warm and real, and the friendships feel genuine.

The sadder parts of the story are approached with sensitivity, and there's a great deal of care put into the tonal balancing throughout all the routes.

The romance is suitably written for high school students, and is all very sweet and with the usual concerns the age group face.

Currently the game doesn't feel fun to play.
Coop doesn't feel like coop you only play next to someone else and your units will go over after finishing your wave and the other way round for you teammate. The random selections at the start are very varied and not all are great. Survival against AI is just a gamble what you get at random at the start and the ai every wave hast something new, so you can't even adept with the random unit selection you can add each wave.
Playing versus ai isn't really challenging or fun to repeat.

The Game has potention but right now isn't really fun to play.
It would be nice to scale how much heal each side gets, so that you could have a longer game. Some games vs ai I won in 5 rounds which is rather short and could be more fun if each side had more rounds to adept to the enemy. Also making presets if it exist i did not find but would be nice to have, so that you can start with an abitly you want and matching starting units.",0

+ The [b]art style[/b] is soft, vibrant, and inoffensive in the best of ways. It reminds me of Slime Rancher but much more grounded.
+ There's [b]no overabundance of pink[/b] (not that its existence is a bad thing, but Rivershine clearly isn't marketing itself in one direction).
+ The [b]music[/b] is very nice! I often have a stream playing on the side to help me focus, but when I do tune into the sounds of Rivershine it's a lovely experience.
+ The [b]horse animations[/b], even for early access, hint at their personality and show a lot of potential. I love watching my horses bring their head around to itch at their shoulder, or stoop down to start grazing. I've also noticed my horses resting one of their back hooves after I've left them for a while. Lots of little details to love!
+ Lots of [b]customization potential[/b]. Options are limited in early access (at least for the player character) but I don't mind as I'm more often looking at my horses. Said horses have a couple different mane and tail styles, coat colors, face masks and sock markings--again, already pretty substantial for early access, and they look gorgeous too!

[h1]EITHER/OR[/h1]
* [b]Farming[/b] doesn't require much commitment. I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but I do think just being able to plant seeds on your ranch, optionally fertilize them, and then come back a few days later to harvest them with no further investment is a nice compromise. It gives you more time to spend with your horses and you still get the benefit of growing stuff yourself. To those that enjoy primarily farming sims, you may wish for more, but considering this is largely a horse game, farming does take a bit of a backseat for sake of streamlining.
* [b]Competition-oriented progression[/b]. Progressing through the game is done primarily by engaging in the cross-country competitions around town. I personally enjoy the races and think with a bit more polish, they'll be a great gameplay loop.
* [b]Large maps[/b] that are good for trail riding, but if your horse is out of stamina (or you're trying to get somewhere on foot), travel can be quite slow. This is somewhat remedied by being able to return to the entrance of the map at any time, and I appreciate that we're being afforded such large spaces, but yeah. Maybe an on-foot sprint for when you're gathering materials could help.

[h1]NEGATIVES[/h1]
[i]Take these with a grain of salt, as the game is still in early access![/i]

- [b]General animation stiffness[/b]. I don't put much weight in this however as again, EA, and the animations are still serviceable. Some horse gaits are a bit choppy or janky, but only if I'm looking at them very closely. With a bit of tweaking I'm sure it'll feel great. Most of the human NPCs and PC are also a bit stiff, but focus seems to be placed on the horses for now, so again this is just an observation.

---

And of course, there are a few bugs (like horses hanging out on top of rooves or control schemes occasionally getting toggled), but the game seems well supported and incredibly substantial for what it is. Rivershine's drawbacks are insignificant compared to everything else it brings to the table, and I can't express how much this game has made me light up even in its current state.

If you've had a hankering for a horse game, then give this one a try and see how it treats you!",1
138299509,1559600,"Overall this is a beautiful and cute horse game. There are some problems: it feels a bit grindy at times with all the competitions you have to do to earn money, the mane and tail physics are a bit janky at times and there are a few weird clips where horses clip into a fence or the reins clip into your horse's neck.
The rest of the game though, the gorgeous and accurate animations of both horse and rider/character really make this game feel alive. Your horse's ears move, your rider will stretch their legs when you're idle. Im really looking forward to playing this game more and see it develop :)",1

So why is my review negative? Because it destroys your computer at random. After entering or leaving a menu the game will lose it's fidelity, chug down to nothing FPS, and if your PC is any worse than an R7 5k and a RTX 3k or equiv the game likely will just crash. And when it does it can enter a crash loop and mess with audio devices. 

Editing the windows settings for the EXE helped a little for a time then it tanked again. Apparently the only way to fix it really from what I can see online is putting it in win 8 compatibility mode which has a chance to have it block you complaining about your OS being out of date, or alternatively disable Ubisoft connect and as I got this to play with a friend, this is being refunded.

Now, the games can be played live and with the proper settings, a live game can be finished in a couple hours. However, we have no ability to name our game lobbies and therefore attract the ""live"" players.

138325452,1179580,"For the $32.48(AUD) introductory price.

I must say that I am enjoying it so far.

It is a simple open world action RPG game.

We have been disappointed with the bigger known companies giving us horrible games lately, so why not support a smaller company/developer instead.

Rather than spending $80-$100 on a piece of crap, let us spend $20-$30 on an Early Access game so they can make it better for everyone and as it says, that the game has ""-A complete main story line with over 30 hours of game play."".

Movement is fine.

Combat is fine.

Aiming is fine.

It is not mind blowing or great or up to the standards of certain AA or AAA games but for the price tag, what do people expect?

The story seems alright so far as the first hour is more like a Tutorial until you get to a certain part, then it opens up on the world in which it tells you what has happened and what you need to do.

I'd say overall, the game is not too bad and as I am enjoying it so far, I will give it a positive review and recommend others to support the smaller companies.

138326229,1940340,"It feels like this game needed more development time and beta testing, gathering feedback from players.

- Lacks the epic score music of the first game. Which is weird, because this is the same composer.
- Has almost none of the tension that made the original practically a new genre
- Difficulty based on RNG
- Roguelite elements feel last minute and unlocks don't feel particularly exciting
- No gamepad support off the bat, will be patched by devs later
- Over-reliance on the community to fix the issues with mods, but modding is not implemented yet (???)
- Managing the stagecoach is an awesome idea, but practically in game it feels unsatisfying and a chore
- Character relationships is an awesome idea executed poorly

I will say however that the narrator (Wayne June) is the strongest point as always and while the material given to him to read in this sequel is not as strong as the first, it is practically worth *the entire purchase price*.

""Darkest Dungeon II"" might not be the best way to name this entry considering it's departure from the formula. It's more like a spin-off than a true sequel.

I know this doesn't sound very *positive* for a game I recommend. 

It's only a word of caution to those that'd be put off by that. Since that's the biggest point of contention people have with this entry.

If you can accept that, I think you're in for a good time.",1
138325763,1940340,"TLDR: It's Slay the Spire in a Darkest Dungeon coat. 


I want to love this game, because the first was one of the most challenging and engaging gaming experiences I've ever experienced. I am still playing Darkest Dungeon 1 even now. But...this game has no depth. 

For items and builds, it went from learning about a region and exploring to 
Fire area = burn heal
Forest = blight heal

And that's it. You're playing Pokemon basically. 

Another issue with this change from regions to path clears (I guess?) is the lack of variety in your comps. You have to spam the #### out of a consistent set of four or five to unlock their abilities. It isn't about your ability to create strong compositions, it's about buffing the obviously best units so you can push further into other runs to get actually new ""content"". 

I was legitimately excited about the relationship system...until I actually played it. Nutshell version: most playthroughs two people will love eachother and two will hate eachother. Pray like hell the two that hate eachother don't put negative traits on your best abilities (but, they probably will). 


What killed the game for me in so many regards is not being able to properly lock in character traits. You have to keep playing them back to back or you will lose their traits and any memories you worked incredibly hard for. So, if you get bored of using the same comp for the 5th run in a row - congrats, you lose all progress. 
These aren't your characters anymore. Unlike the first DD, where you fought like hell (and prayed equally) with your characters to survive and overcome the challenges, DD2 just goes ""eh"" and literally chucks them in a ditch with a broken carriage.

It takes away the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon - the fear of losing your team, whether because you care about them or just from the work put into them, and replaces it with a grind even WoW players would raise an eyebrow at. The game doesn't give you a reason to care. So why should you?",0

138325643,1940340,"I had played this for a few hours and prob close to a hundred on the first one so I like to give my personal opinions on one of my favorite game. 
First: The two game are not the same. While some mechanic like stress and the brutal combat is still similar and almost the same in most aspect, the upgrade is still vaguely familiar. The comparison stop there.
Second: The first game you play like a leader of a doomed mercenary group allowing you to hire and fire any characters you like to siege the Darkest Dungeon. In this game you play as a leader of said mercenary group responsible for keeping the people in your team to survive as long as you can.
Third: Some people complain that this game is not similar enough to the previous one should just keep playing the first one because it still a perfect game that can probably give you several hundred hours more of game play.

138325603,758690,"Enjoying the game so far. I haven't run into any bugs, though there are some non-intuitive things that might give the impression of bugs.

It looks like it's maybe clipped through the floor but in reality it's just in a storage within a menu. Another is that the broken atv you find is deliberately slow, it says this in the text but people don't read and realise they need to build a new one to get faster.

I'd recommend giving the game a shot if it's something you've been waiting for. It very much has a Subnautica on Mars feel to it. It's certainly early access so go in with that expectation and you'll have fun.",1

138326218,669330,"Really interesting game with a lot of potential! Here are a few ideas I had whilst playing.

I'd really like if there was a rematch button.

Wish that air units had a few more unit options, as they feel a little underutilized compared to the ground units.

Wish the unit roster was slightly larger in general.

I think it would be fun if there were a few more nonconventional units like the hacker.

I found this personally more engaging than other autobattle type games like tabs and teamfight tactics.

There feels like there are some slight roguelike elements with gathering different modules and applying them to the right units.

Airstrikes and uno-reverse card abilities are a good way to level the playing field if you're falling behind. However, this requires a decent amount of forethought, as these abilities are usually pretty resource intensive. Ideally these should compliment your strategy instead of acting as a crutch.

Would maybe be interesting to include other buildings except the energy towers.

The core thought of trying to make the game balanced and truly strategic is interesting, and I am very curious where it will go throughout its development. Often I feel like video games made with the ambition of it being competitive and therefore decently fair tends to make the game stale, sacrificing many of the creative advantages of the video game as a format. Truly fun but also competitive games are rare.

I wish the devs good luck with development. I find the current state of the product impressive, but with room for complexity. I have hope that they can deliver on something that hasn't really been done in this way as far as I know.",1

This game has soo many features, its truly a software marvel BUT, we've seen it all before. Copy and pasting the same formula over and over again is the same reason Nitro Pepsi  failed so hard, its not an original idea. I want a far cry that's a new original where things are shaken up from the repetitive pattern. Far Cry 5 was nice for the change but had horrible execution and TERRIBLE DLC, Far Cry 6 is just a far cry with every other aspect of a Ubisoft  game that was remotely successful, or they've overloaded their memories to what is successful and cram it all into the same box: they've forgotten how to do anything else or even learn from their mistakes or be original in their ideas of creation. 

Far Cry 6 is just another Far Cry that was, stupidly, held off of Steam. The game itself looks great, has decent gun play but a lot of bugs and FPS drops on capable hardware.

138327375,1940340,"There's a significant amount of changes that I don't agree with. The main problem stems from the fact that it feels like you don't get the actual game and are working with a limited amount of content from the start. DD1 in comparison has dungeons that are difficult yes, but are beatable with scalable encounters. The lack of preparation here and meaningful choice doesn't sit right with me.",0
138327327,1940340,"This game is so weird to give a judgement on since it's clearly something fantastic with a lot of potential, but for every step forward, there's one back in another direction. None of the changes come without an issue.

The game is now much more traditional of a roguelike, similar to Slay The Spire. This change can be a hit or miss for some people, but I personally love the change. There are varied reasons to choose each route and the variety on items can either ruin a run or save it on a coin flip, which is part of the essence of darkest dungeon. 
The issue is, these runs are so damn long. An average run going to the boss of Act 2 onwards can easily take over an hour. Going through all this effort just to lose due to a bad dice roll can feel incredibly shitty, or having to slog through with a mediocre build just to suffer at the end can really make it feel like the game does not respect your time. But... that's also kind of the essence of darkest dungeon.

The combat system is fantastic, I love how the game simplified aspects of the previous game and expanded others, its led to a much more engaging experience when fighting enemies since there are so many moving parts. The UI in battles is also quite a downgrade in utility, but better visually. It looks great, but the game tells you very little about anything upfront. Having to inspect enemies to view what they do, not being able to view other heroes abilities or estimated damage. This makes calculating and planning much harder to do in combat, since you basically need to estimate numbers and wait until the game allows you to finish a thought process. Nevertheless, the combat is still incredibly fun, challenging, and satisfying.

I love the idea of Paths. Each character having variety in archetypes that buff certain play styles. However, a lot of these feel incredibly niche or unfun. Some specifically buff one specific attack a hero has, basically forcing them to be a one trick pony, while others are almost un-noticeable. The best ones in the game belong to Grave robber, Vestal and Flagellant (the two latest characters added...) that have Paths that not only give stat changes, but rework skills to work differently at a base level, or make more niche skills significantly better than your previous bread and butter. This should be what they all were like! It leads to a meaningful choice and more variety on what roles each character can fill. If there is a meaningful rework to the paths, I pray that they all end up like this. (though a small improvement would be if the game actually told you what was being changed between each path for each skill, instead of just saying ""adjusted skills."")

An issue I really cannot defend is the tutorials and introductions to the game. This game has an abhorrent new player experience due to how poorly it conveys what its systems are. Discover a new mechanic? Consult the novel that breaks half the time to mark every tutorial as read so you do not even know what the game just added into it. Unsure of a system? Scroll through and guess where it is. Even after that, there are still so many mechanics unexplained. I didn't know that different Inn's grant different bonuses based on the icon in the top left. The game never says that, but it says so much more that feels unnecessary. These things can be done in a much better way, this just feels lazy. The Combat glossary is also a major misstep. If the combat requires a cheat sheet to understand icons, then the icons are not doing their job of simplifying things, they are adding another step. If they kept the idea of just adding words, people would be able to assume what it does. It does not help that some icons shown in abilities don't actually show up in the cheat sheet, while some exclusive to one single enemy with an unhelpful description do. It just screams a system made for those who already understand it, and a tutorial made that just assumes the player already gets the gist of it. Thankfully I did, but a new player shouldn't be assumed to know everything the game is trying to do.

Lastly, this game really needs a bit of polish in terms of bugs, hiccups, and oversights. Nothing game breaking, but small signs that makes the 1.0 seem less like a full release. Any time the game is closed directly to desktop, every setting reverts to default. Character names don't save between runs if you have customised them, always reverting to default. FPS drops any time that rain is showing. UI being clunky to navigate since every keybind is scattered across the keyboard (and the previous setting bug means rebinding them is a waste of time.) These should've been caught in early access really. It is just disappointing to find so many small signs of carelessness in a product that is so bursting with care in other parts.

I'm sure it goes without saying but visually and audibly the game is phenomenal. I have 0 problems with how the game looks and sounds. They clearly put tons of effort into this, but the rough edges really need some ironing out. I would highly recommend this game, but I don't think the dev's should pat themselves on the back and say that their product is done (which, in fairness, they haven't done.) A ""Mostly Positive"" is probably the best score for the game as of now.",1
138327226,1940340,"Amazing game. TBH if you find the first game too much of a grind, the change to a more roguelite approach makes the game more approachable to newer players. 
The new approach allows players to feel less hurt for losing characters as the small upgrades progression allows lost of a character to be ""stronger"" for your next run.
Players of the previous game might not like the new approach of the game due to the vastly different approach but i'd say try it first.",1
138327209,1940340,"The first Darkest Dungeon made me feel stressed and excited at the same time while I played it.   It made me feel attached to my heroes, and concerned for them.   But I felt that I had control of my actions, and could figure out what was happening and why.   

   Darkest Dungeon 2 doesn't have that.    I've only played a few hours and I can see a lot of awesome things about this game, but I'm just not having fun.   The art is great, the animations are even better.

Also I need to address that Ubisoft has completely altered the parkour mechanics to a pile of shit, I'm not saying that old Far Cry's had it better but this one feels like it's struggling allot even to climb simple ladder.
I'm not sure if I'm the only one facing this issue of the character not climbing a simple ledge of the height of he's knee, forgetting to vault over obstacles and overall making the parkour even more clunky than it was, basically I'm feeling the lack of freedom while freerunning which was never the problem before on older entries. The story is good but not great, anyways I dont care bout the story anyways cuz I'm more of a fan of the action in it but an addition of a better or a unique story would have been appreciated. The WORST part is Ubisoft Connect, the name is ironical to it's service and I CAN NOT make it connect online what so ever hence not able to cloud save my data at all, I wanna say this to Ubi (If you dont know how to make a launcher then please learn, just changing the name from Uplay to the current one won't change a thing, or just drop it) running Ubisoft Connect has been a nightmare also lost all my Ubi points as well still don't know how and why?!. Anyways....aside from the bad part, there's also gems beneath being the beautiful graphics and the tropical island settings with a ton of different weapons and vehicles to choose from to suite your style of play. I still think that this frenchise is far from over and I havent lost all hope in it yet like Assassin's creed. Hope Ubi dosent messes this up as well.

A bullet heaven with a fairly weak presentation in terms of graphics, core gameplay (it's one of those without auto-shooting, for the most part), with basic weaponry such as pistols and shotguns and even the first match or two certainly won't feel like one of the greatests around. Takes a while to become truly strong, and it's very easy to die. There's a few interesting ideas however, such as constantly refreshing and upgradable shop to buy upgrades in rather than straight level up rewards, a couple fun abilities to use, a gacha-esque way to unlock extra content quicker and specific characters to unlock harder versions of the various levels in the game, and the power increments have the player absolutely spray bullets in no time. So yeah, it takes a little bit of time to get there, but Burst Hero is already fun and surprisingly deep in this current version of Early Access.

But oh my fucking god they fumbled everything else.  It's a tiresome slog to get anywhere, nothing feels permanent or like you're making any real progress at all.  It's a tiresome, boring slog through the same encounters and the stagecoach mechanic really doesn't help, it's just a glorified loading screen to the next set piece.

I could go on for hours about how the combat is trash because they've 'dumbed it down' with this token system, the fact that every boss is just a complete shambles because unless you have a very specific team ready at that moment, good fucking luck beating the gimmick.  

But the MOST damning thing about this game is that I do not give a single fuck about any of my party members because they'll either win (and disappear) or die (and disappear).  I don't have a stable of Champion level heroes who I can tell stories about.  ""Oh man this is Billybob the Leper and he went Stalwart at just the right moment and it was epiiiic!""

The auto-battler I have been looking for.

Mechabellum is an epic 1v1 or 2v2 auto-battler where battles take place as a series of rounds in two phases. A prep phase and a battle phase. In the prep phase, players place down units and use their abilities to influence the tides of battle. In the battle phase, players have no influence and they can't do anything but watch the epicness unfold. 

The game has a well balanced rock/paper/scissors style counter system which means that there is no single unit that will just win the game because it is too good and there is no strategy that is invincible. Some level of luck is involved in the start of the game but as long as a player is adaptable, even a poor start could lead to victory. Even experienced high level players can be defeated by beginners if the strategies add up. 

The community is a strange mixed bag of extremely toxic and newbie friendly. When I first played, there were players insulting each other for one reason or another but there are always players who help give advice when you ask. 

People have mentioned that there were people who cheat using the very rough spectator system. Admittedly, this had never happened to me after I played roughly a hundred matches. It is important to remember that this game is early access so not everything is perfect. the rating system needs work, there needs to be some more balancing done on the starting load outs, and some units definitely feel like they need some kind of buff or extra upgrade options.

138817060,1304930,"when you have tryhards in your group thats when i start laughing my ass off to the point where i cannot breathe and evan you suck at this game, i allowed comments just so you can say something",1
138817028,1304930,"A few aspects of this game really stand out - others are just generally good.

Firstly, the level design. It is incredibly well done. The lobby is a place you can hang out with your group, or a bunch of strangers who are other subjects. There's even a fun mini-game of arm wrestling and a massive board with many statistics of yours that you can look up to see you in comparison to other subjects in the lobby. 
You can customize your room with some props, textures for walls, bed, sink etc. Not only that, there's also an option of customizing your character's looks. And it's all paid for with in-game currency that you earn quickly enough to not get burned out or have to grind hard to get a skin you want. 
The trial maps' level design is impeccable. They have different objectives, always filled up with a bunch of enemies that will keep lurking around. Every time you visit a location, it is changed up a little bit. The objectives change places, doors are different, 

Stability of the game is awesome. I think the only one issue is that under some very specific circumstances (meaning it's a very rare issue), enemies may clip through the door.
If you get disconnected, you can always join your friends in the trial back - you get spawned near the place at which you lost connection - and can always pick your items (including objective items) back from the ground.

Sound, music and ambience is good. Sets the mood, you get audible cues when alerting enemies or if someone's being chased. Voice acting on the other hand - I think this is what stands out much more.

The artwork, level of detail, and general graphics are awesome. The cinematics and even the tutorial level are really fenomenal. They also explain lore of this game.

Give the game a try. It's honestly worth it.",1
138814423,2284460,"dmc4-style inertia cranked up to 11000 and a fun parry-teleport system gave me some enjoyment but the game is essentially massive hordes of projectile spam enemies and an occasional miserable ""run away from the wall"" level",0
138816062,1940340,"It's a beautiful game with similar combat to the original Darkest Dungeon, but does not overshadow it. Instead, I feel as though it is merely a continuation of the series. 

It also has a lovely ""failing forward"" mechanic to make it less punishing, and optional harder difficulty modes you unlock through that mechanic. 

Certainly a good game to play if you enjoyed the combat system of Darkest Dungeon but did not enjoy investing so much into your characters just for them to die of blight or bleeding.",1
138815454,1940340,"Only played DD1 co-op (with Parsec) for about an hour with some friends, but enjoyed watching people stream it.  Played DD2 co-op on Parsec for about 7 hours when it released on Steam, and went and bought the game to keep playing for myself.
I'm absolutely terrible at it, but am having a good, frustrating, exhilarating time.  I'm maybe going to beat the second big, big boss (like I said, I'm terrible) when I play next, and am looking forward to more challenges.  I really enjoy the 'Battle of the Mountain' as well.  Not much of a review, but I'm supposed to type something.",1
138815274,1940340,"I get it... the game is hard and only for l337 players or whatever. The thing is I love everything about it except the game-play.

The worst part is that I can't get a refund cause I've spent too much time inches beyond the prologue, so I haven't even gotten to the good stuff I know is waiting.",0
138815063,1940340,Wayne June does a fantastic job as the narrator but the gameplay is repetitive and uninspiring. It's a no from me.,0

Los integrantes de la partida son tan progres que sólo saben sentir envidia y ofensas entre ellos, jodiendote la partida de lo mas lindo. El resto está OK, el arte soberbio, la música se queda contigo rondando en tu mente, la voz del narrador sigue ahi y es perfecta. 
Si como yo jugaste el early acces verás que este sencillamente se caga en todo lo bueno que tenia el early. 
SI jugaste el primero y te encantó, no juegues este. Poco o casi nada queda del DD antiguo en este juego. Si no has jugado el primero quizas este DD te guste, aunque de dungeon poco o nada tiene, quizás solo el nombre.",0
138814911,1940340,"It's a hybrid of Slay the Spire and DD1, maybe Slay the Darkest Dungeon would fit better than DD2.

Slay has excellent Controller/Steam-Deck support, DD2 at the moment has not...it's really missed!",1
138814512,1940340,"Incredible game! First off, don't expect the exact same experience as Darkest Dungeon I. The negative reviews here are people with unrealistic expectations that they would just be basically getting an expansion to the first game. Ridiculous. This has all the same flavor of the first with a completely different gaming experience. I love it!",1
138813791,1940340,"I have like a trillion hours in DD1 and I have tried so damn hard to like this.
But it's just absolute dogshit by comparison, and even standalone.  
The art and animations are all stellar, the soundtrack slaps.

Wayne June as the narrator is still good but definitely less... impactful the second time around, literally none of these lines are anywhere near as memorable.  ""Remind yourself"" yadayada.  I think it's because the narrator in this one is supposed to be nice to you?  It's less forboding than the Ancestor.

But oh my fucking god they fumbled everything else.  It's a tiresome slog to get anywhere, nothing feels permanent or like you're making any real progress at all.  It's a tiresome, boring slog through the same encounters and the stagecoach mechanic really doesn't help, it's just a glorified loading screen to the next set piece.

I could go on for hours about how the combat is trash because they've 'dumbed it down' with this token system, the fact that every boss is just a complete shambles because unless you have a very specific team ready at that moment, good fucking luck beating the gimmick.  

But the MOST damning thing about this game is that I do not give a single fuck about any of my party members because they'll either win (and disappear) or die (and disappear).  I don't have a stable of Champion level heroes who I can tell stories about.  ""Oh man this is Billybob the Leper and he went Stalwart at just the right moment and it was epiiiic!""  

This whole game just reeks of time-sink much, much more than DD1 and that game was pushing it.

The Negatives reviewers, shame on them, they probably haven’t played the old classics before

I bought the game yesterday and I’m already on Level 19, I pretty much mastered the controls already!

I saw a couple City Stuntz Bikers on a character selection, my hope you’ll have THEE Rocket Racer as a playable character, I have ideas to remake his car for the old games.

So from me, my truly honest rating is 10/10, it has brought back so much memories when I was at elementary and I’m glad to have a Lego Racers 3 like game!

The game has some really compelling concepts, the vertical world, and the environments.

To succeed it feels like you have to run in, get one poke and try to dodge out of the way, you aren't really going to land a combo unless you parry something.

I've even personally owned 2 of the 3 guns in the prologue.  The assemble/disassembly procedures are all pretty spot on.

I find the general game play mechanics relatively simple enough to pick up with being neither too hard nor too easy.  The built in tutorial system makes it easy enough to figure out as well.

I have a few very minor issues with one or two of the mechanics (namely the cleanse effect disappearing after the end of the turn at the bird boss feeling unfair and the Rhino boss sprinting deep into the purple goop to the point where it's not targetable) but it's incredibly fun.

138816107,669330,"8/10

The auto-battler I have been looking for.

Mechabellum is an epic 1v1 or 2v2 auto-battler where battles take place as a series of rounds in two phases. A prep phase and a battle phase. In the prep phase, players place down units and use their abilities to influence the tides of battle. In the battle phase, players have no influence and they can't do anything but watch the epicness unfold. 

The game has a well balanced rock/paper/scissors style counter system which means that there is no single unit that will just win the game because it is too good and there is no strategy that is invincible. Some level of luck is involved in the start of the game but as long as a player is adaptable, even a poor start could lead to victory. Even experienced high level players can be defeated by beginners if the strategies add up. 

The community is a strange mixed bag of extremely toxic and newbie friendly. When I first played, there were players insulting each other for one reason or another but there are always players who help give advice when you ask. 

People have mentioned that there were people who cheat using the very rough spectator system. Admittedly, this had never happened to me after I played roughly a hundred matches. It is important to remember that this game is early access so not everything is perfect. the rating system needs work, there needs to be some more balancing done on the starting load outs, and some units definitely feel like they need some kind of buff or extra upgrade options.

As the game is, it is rough but it is one of the best early access games around.",1

138815900,1062810,"This game gets MUCH closer to the Slay the Spire formula while still maintaining the scaling potential that Monster Train had in it's damage calculations. By this I mean I can tell that on highest difficulties your health and how much you spend per combat is going to be very important. I'm very eager to unlock more things to see how things play out, but so far I'm LOVING this one. The combat is fun and trying to play around the damage that you will end up taking is a challenge depending on what build you're going for. 

I don't care about monetization models when they are only cosmetics and needing an internet connection for this game isn't a deal breaker for me. There are others I'll play when I'm off the grid. I want to play this one co-op most of the time anyway probably?",1

138817116,1268750,"So far even in its early access phase there's a great blend of FPS gameplay and tower defense construction. Chat is easily directed between smaller squads and the total global group. The progression path for the three classes is enticing, and the starting gunplay is already good to go. Some technical issues with the server lag do make sniping the hitboxes a bit of an issue, but it's still fun as it is; the hope of course it'll all only get better as time goes on and the game matures.

The early access game appears to only have one single map, but I may be just missing some option as I wasn't the squad leader for most of the night. There are day and night cycles that appear to randomly change between games and that makes for some interesting variety in the missions. Nighttime could probably stand to be darker and creepier, but having the variation is at least a good thing as it is. Looking forward to more!",1
